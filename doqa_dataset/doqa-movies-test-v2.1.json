Probably in the books he is the one who kills the Night King, because it was clear from David Benioff's interview that they wanted to subvert expectations, they wanted someone who was not Jon to kill the Night King. So I think in the books he came back to life for also killing the NK. He was brought back to do a lot of things if you start to see it that way, a chain of events that led to a lot of things. Defeated Ramsay, showed the World that the dead are coming, prepared for the Long Night and battle of Winterfell. Successfully defeating NK would not have been possible without him. What the Lord of Light could have wanted? Well, we don't even know what LoL was, didn't know what his intentions were, who were his enemy but one thing we know for sure, all victories inevitably came at a cost. To bring a new World, Jon Snow had to stab his love in the belly. So there we have the Azor Ahai theory jumping in, not totally similar but was a good deal. CANNOTANSWER",

In fact, we see that Obi-Wan Kenobi is referred to as General Kenobi in Star Wars films set after the events of the Clone Wars, so we can be reasonably sure that there is nothing prohibiting Jedi killing people in battle. However, at the point you are asking about in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, Count Dooku is an unarmed opponent and poses little to no further threat. The Jedi way would have been to arrest him, not murder him, as Anakin himself correctly says in the quote in the question. CANNOTANSWER",

Until the episode \"Life of Brian\", I assumed that he was the only animal who could speak consistently (other animals speak on one off occasions for comedy).    Then Vinny came along and changed everything.   So that got me thinking, \"How many dogs can talk?\" and \"If Vinny died before Brian came back from the dead would there be another dog who could replace Vinny, who would still be able to talk?\"  So that's my question.  Has Seth MacFarlane ever stated if there are any other dogs/animals that can talk consistently?",

In unremarkable clothing, it isn't strange that no one stopped him. As for security systems, if you watch more of the series, you'll notice that Frank is always aware of when he is being recorded. I don't believe his action was spur of the moment. He chose to meet her there and do the deed because he had an way out where any recording of him wouldn't be enough to identify him, especially with the hat and glasses. Would that be possible in the real world? Could there actually be a blind spot all the way out of the station? Unclear. Her death was likely ruled an accident because metro police departments are overworked, and there isn't any immediate evidence to the contrary. The fact that they wouldn't find the angle and direction of her fall suspicious bother me too, I don't have an answer for that. CANNOTANSWER",

      "title": "What changed the Judge's sympathy?",
      "background": "In Find Me Guilty, at the beginning of the trial, Judge Finestein had little empathy for Jackie DiNorscio. This can be shown by the Judge slapping first a $5000 then upping it to $10000 fine for Contempt of Court. He also is more apt to sustain the Prosecutor's objections.  By the end of the trial, the Judge appears very sympathetic to Jackie D., for example, the way he expresses complete understanding and remorse for Jackie when DiNorscio's mother passes. IIRC, he overrules objections by the Prosecutor and sustains the Defenses, esp Jackie D's.  I never get the feeling that the 'mob' bought the Judge, but rather he has become more sympathetic towards them, again especially concerning Jackie.  Can anyone site specific (objective) examples of what precipitates this change of heart?",

I love you.\" 3 - Jackie pays for Tony's mother's funeral.(normally what good guys do.) 4 - Jackie shows a old picture of his gang to the citizens in the court and says about how they're conspiring to buy an ice cream in front of the parlour. 5 - In the end, citizens in the court gives verdict and says that they find all the defendants are not guilty despite all the evidence and witnesses. Jackie is very clever and he knows the only way he is gonna win is by gaining public's and judge's sympathy that's why he keeps mentioning about gang members' families and their children and repeatedly asks the public not to separate the gang members from their family by sending them jail and in the end he tells to his gang to bring fake families to the court on final verdict to gain more sympathy. The scenes I've explained above may not be exact 'cause I've seen this long ago but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. CANNOTANSWER",

There are several (at least 3, maybe 4) appearances of dogs in the movie. What does Leone want to say with the wild dogs? I think it's too easy to say the dogs stands for something like freedom or to try to illustrate the empty desert better. The pictures are the first and the last appearance of dogs in the movie.   Maybe the last dog is important to answer the question. It looks like the dog wants to run to Tuco but he scares the dog, so it runs out of the picture.

Now that we have the rating system, films can be classified by their rating. Today's ratings are, at least by idea, implemented by our peers. So as society changes so do those who review and rate films. That is why we see more profanity in PG rated films, as parents who rate the films accept the fact that children in this age group use these profane words or acknowledge that the film works the way the script was written. New ratings were introduced including PG-13. To address the need for films that target a segment of the population that are pre-adult but seek adult style films.

Part of this comes from the Quarter Quell, where Katniss (to the public at least) apparently abandons Peeta. It's also a massive personal and demoralising blow against Katniss.

This is very different from making copies of film reels where only the original have the quality of the original (each copy adds a little imperfection). Now, the question The Prestige asks is what if you can make a perfect clone of a person the way you can perfectly copy digital data? In one sense, if we don't want to get too uncomfortable we can always say the remaining copy is now the real data and the deleted copy is not real anymore. But if you really think about it and get out of your comfort zone you will realize that both people are real and what you have done is murdered yourself. In The Prestige this point is much more clearly made as the old copied Angier becomes the one who is killed. Not the newly created clone. Every time the clone will have only the memory of the surviving Angier. But every time Angier experiences death, only the Angier that experienced death has no way of passing that memory to the surviving Angier so the survivor can never know what dying feels like.

      "background": "The 1977 movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind is truly iconic, and one of my all time favorites. But there is one thing I am curious about.  During the climax, we see the aliens returning many people to the Earth. Most of them look like they are from a time far behind. Also, the other things that the aliens return during the movie are all very old things (taken a long time ago) eg.- Airplanes in Mexico, a ship in Mongolia. However there is one exception -- the 3 year old kid -- Barry, who is taken away by the aliens and returned back soon thereafter (at the end of the movie).  How did this happen? What could be the reason for this exceptional behavior of aliens?",
      "paragraphs": [
        {
          "context": "To me, this makes perfect sense. Given that we never know where the Aliens come from, how long the trip takes, or what happens to the people on the ship, I assume that the return of missing vehicles and such corresponds with the overall plot of the film. The aliens are returning stuff in an attempt to progress contact with humans. It is all stuff they took in an inquisitive manner (or maybe just to show they could). The reason Barry is returned so soon is that his abduction corresponds close in time with that final interaction. If nothing came of all that interaction, I would assume child Barry would show up years later during the next attempted contact. But this is all just speculation and opinion. Realistically, it is probably just an emotional tie that Spielberg wanted. CANNOTANSWER",

He had imagined that she did kill herself, after the bad mouth from the others (including Oh Dae-su, that's why the revenge). But in the process, he (I can't remember his name) is reminded that he couldn't stand the rumors, so he killed her. As this falls into place in his mind, he kills himself out of guilt. For the second question, I didn't get that Oh was hypnotized again at the end, to forget that about Mi-do. I thought he cut out the tongue so that the antagonist would not tell Mi-do. If that's so with hypnosis again (I don't own the DVD, can't check), I think it should be open to interpretation for the viewer what Oh knows at the end. CANNOTANSWER",

Believe it or not finding out this answer is harder than it sounds without also being exposed to spoilers and impossible without being exposed to (unwanted) reviewers opinions. I just want a neutral answer.  As for what constitutes origin story being opinion: I'd say if the movie starts with the viewer having to accept he has powers somehow and no more than 15% of time is spent on short flashbacks that hint at his origins: that is not an origin story for the purposes of this question. Anything more that that about origins is.",

There is no cut in the movie where you could say: \"Okay, NOW origin is over\" because (again, highly opinionated), only at the end of the movie is the character fully developed and whole.

It is a bit of a shocking scene; the shock would not be nearly as strong if the viewer already knew Gollum's origin. So, in the opening of The Fellowship of the Ring, that Gollum was once a hobbit named Sméagol is an extraneous detail.

Other scenario is when something happens in the real world and the series has an episode that deals with a similar theme. Take as an example the shootings that happened in France recently. Some networks will alter the airing order of episodes in a series to avoid a similar subject to avoid the sensationalism, other may try to cash on it and air sooner an episode that dealed with something similar. Also, a network can try to get people into watching their series and getting high ratings, airing the \"best\" episodes of a series first (i.e. the ones with the more action, or drama, or sex, etc.). Then, when the series go to DVD the numbering order is usually the scripted order and not the airing one, that's why both differ. CANNOTANSWER",

Their future technology actually does allow them to replace people who were not about to die, but they regard this as a moral problem and it is forbidden. But they can take over those lives if they were about to be eliminated from the timeline, hence the apparent paradox of \"saving\" McClaren. But they haven't actually saved McClaren at all, they have replaced him with a traveller. Early in the series only people about to die get replaced. Obviously the whole point is to alter the timeline but the travellers are aiming not for minor alterations like saving a single, random life, but for big alterations that radically change the course of history. One of their protocols actually forbids them from saving other lives as well even when they know someone is about to die (but not be replaced). This [minor spoiler alert] becomes a source of some dramatic tension in later episodes. CANNOTANSWER",

Fox) sings Johnny B. Goode by Chuck Berry.    In both movies, neither character was supposed to be singing Both songs were written by African Americans in the late 1950's Both songs were written in the future compared to the time the scenes were set in (the scene from Back to The Future was set in 1955, and as far as I can tell Top Secret was set during WWII) Both songs were clearly unexpected by both the listeners and the band Most of the listeners in both movies gradually liked the song more and more (except until the end in Back to The Future) Both movies had a lot of focus on a red electric guitar at the end of the song Possible similarity: In Back to The Future, Marty tells the band \"this is a blues riff in 'B',\" and in Top Secret, Nick also tells the band something, but I couldn't make out what he said.    My first thought was that since Top Secret is a parody film, that they got the idea from Back to The Future, but according to IMDB, Top Secret was released a year before Back to The Future.   So, my question is: did the makers of Back to The Future get the idea from Top Secret? Is it possible that the makers of Top Secret got the idea from Back to The Future before it was released? or are the similarities I see between to the two scenes merely coincidental?",

As a frustrated musician, I was in my glory, learning the guitar chords and lead solo arrangements, as well as working with a choreographer to mimic and incorporate into the production number the signature styles and stage moves of my rock and roll heroes.” (Lucky Man: A Memoir, p, 144) Top Secret was actually a parody of Elvis films (imdb, Wikipedia, Rotten Tomatoes), so it had a different inspiration.

      "background": "In Disney's movie Aladdin (1992), Aladdin tricks the Genie into getting him and Abu out of the cave where they are trapped. After that, Genie explains that from then on, only valid wishes will be accepted and makes a big deal about it.  Aladdin then wishes to become a prince. Later he is saved before drowning, but he cannot talk so he really doesn't wish for it. But he does actually wish later for the Genie's freedom. Which would bring it to only 2 real wishes based on Genie's rules.  After that, in the end, a free Genie quickly gives the lamp to Aladdin, and presses him to wish for something “impossible” (making a joke with the homophones “the Nile” and “denial”), so Aladdin wishes for the Nile/denial and gets a “No way!” in response.  Does the Genie trick Aladdin into using his real last wish? And if he does, why?",

After being rejected, he steps out of the shop, and at the same time, the owner's daughter -- Anjali(Tanuja) -- is seen entering the shop. After this, there is a song sequence where Dev Anand encounters a group of girls (including Anjali) on a country side road. The song sequence suggests that Dev Anand was intentionally walking in front of the car to tease girls. After a little hustle, they are acquainted.   Later, when Dev Anand is finally employed at the same jewelry shop, Tanuja pays a visit, and Dev Anand tries to sell necklaces to her. However, after a little playing she reveals that she is the owner's daughter, and Dev Anand shows as if he did not know this, and is completely surprised.  Was the surprise true or false?  Did he know her well and that is why he followed her after being rejected by his father? Was he looking for another way to get in, and then he tried to play it smart by pretending that he did not know who she really was?  Or was it a mere coincidence that Dev Anand happened to be on the same road as Tanuja, and teasing some random girls soon after he was denied a job at her father's shop?",

But I've found a pair of details that actually point out that Quasimodo and the gyspy woman aren't related: 1. Quasimodo doesn't have the hair and skin color of a gyspy. 2. Neither she or the gyspy man with her call Quasimodo \"son\" (they may not be wife and husband!).  In the novel, Quasimodo's origin is unknown: He was left abandoned on the street, then he was found and adopted by Frollo because of compassion. Later in the novel, Frollo turns evil and insane because of his lust towards Esmeralda. Based on this, it is interesting to notice that Disney split the novel's Frollo into three characters: Frollo himself, the Arch Deacon and the gypsy woman, so it can be concluded that she adopted Quasimodo because of compassion.",

As such, while it is intriguing to consider possibilities, there is no hint, aside from disreprencies with portrayals, that the gypsi woman was not Quasimodo's true mother.

In one of the final scenes, a bare footed Rose walks to the railing of the search ship, climbs up on it in similar fashion to when she and Jack were on the prow of the Titanic, and throws it into the ocean.  The accepted answer in Why did Lovett invite Rose aboard his search boat in Titanic? suggests Rose threw it overboard for 'closure', but I simply cannot understand how that was closure. After all, it is not as though Jack (when alive) had any real interest in it. Nor did Rose. It was of interest only to her fiance Cal (who took his own life in 1929, when the stock market crashed).  It could be said that the return of the 'Heart of the Ocean' to the ocean, was ..poetic in a sense, but how was it closure? If not closure, then why did she do it?  Update  Interestingly, the original script differs from the movie in that the people searching for the diamond are there to witness her throwing it overboard. She even has a few words with Lovett as he is holding the object of his desire in his hand.     You look for treasure in the wrong place, Mr. Lovett. Only life is precious, and making each day count.   Another snatch of the script that might be relevant:    The hardest part of being so poor, was being so rich. But every time I thought of selling it, I thought of Cal. And somehow I always got by without his help.",

But everytime, he manages to get up again and carry on like \"everything is fine\".  Maybe I'm too demanding for a show based on a zombie apocalypse, but still, how is it that none of those injuries has left any permanent damages.",

          "context": "It is a common fact on TV that combat and injuries are stylized to make it look good rather than realistic. Have a look at pretty much any film fight where someone knows a martial art and compare that to someone who knows a martial art fighting for real. They are worlds apart. Even if you look at American Wrestling and BJJ you can see the difference. Knocking someone out with one punch is extremely difficult, especially if they are used to combat. I have taken an unpulled hit from a quarter staff on the top of my head which caused me to blackout later but I still didn't go down at the time. After almost 20 years of martial arts and living in rough areas I have only been knocked unconscious with one punch once, when I was 17 by the European Kickboxing champion. I was punched to the ground by a bouncer in Portsmouth when I was 20 but was still conscious until he stamped on my head. Most of the people in the Walking Dead would have starved or succumb to injuries by now if they were suffering this scenario for real. Not to mention being struck down by illness. It is just a convention of the media that people are routinely knocked out in one hit and recover completely when the plot demands it and don't when the plot demands that instead. CANNOTANSWER",

After the swimming is over Kenny tells George he'd like to visit his home, so George agrees & Kenny goes to his house whilst naked.   So George asked him like this:    George: Are you out of your mind?    Kenny: What's the matter?    George: You can't go home like that.    Kenny: We're invisible. Don't you know that?   I didn't understand the use of \"invisible\" in this scene context, what makes them invisible?",
      "paragraphs": [
        {
          "context": "I thought the film's use of the theme was much more politicized than the book's. In the book, when Kenny says that he and George are invisible, I wasn't quite sure what he meant. In the movie, invisibility has been threaded throughout much more explicitly: in the classroom scene George clearly describes “invisible minorities” to his class. I took this as the filmmaker's attempt to make the historical particularities of George's situation clear. In the book, however, Kenny's comment sort of complicates George's understanding of his own minority position. Throughout the book, George believes his pain is invisible to others because society has refused to acknowledge his relationship. He thinks this is a somewhat unique situation, because of his position as a gay man in a homophobic society. Kenny's comment, however, suggests that invisibility is more inclusive than that. Perhaps Kenny means that they're invisible because they're out when no one expects them to be out, or because their homosocial behavior isn't understood by society, or because they're powerless to stop the Cuban Missile Crisis. Or, perhaps Kenny knows that George is gay and is trying to have an experience by sharing the evening with him. I don't know and I don't think we're supposed to know. One of the fantastic things about this novel for me is the way it explodes the idea that we grow closer to others by understanding them better. Caring, closeness, and love in the novel aren't degraded by failures of understanding. CANNOTANSWER",

There are several instances throughout the movie where his character makes statements to his crew as to why he's doing things the way he is, which, while unpopular at the outset, made sense and was bought into after the explanation. He used this same common sense seamanship to bring the conclusion which happened. With the ending, he took a gamble, relying on his instincts as a veteran of the seas. He didn't know the Russian ship was going to fire on the base, but was hoping for some kind of resolution which didn't require his boat to fire. While he was given the order to fire from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Donnegan, he knew it would create bigger issues and further hostilities. Having the Russian Captain Andropov onboard and believing in him was a good step towards making this happen. Without Andropov, it probably wouldn't have turned out the same way. He trusted the Captain to help him and hoped the Captain trusted him in the same way. Andropov's intervention with the crew of the Russian vessel allowed him the best course of action. It wasn't that he forced someone else to fire, he only hoped it would happen without his having to do it. In the end, everything worked out for the best (ex machina?). CANNOTANSWER",

For some time toward the end of the movie, it looked like Mia was not going to accept her princessship (that should be a word), implying that the Baroness thought she was quite likely to become Queen. Of course, given that Mia does decide to become a proper princess, anything the Baroness may have done in preparation for ascending to the throne herself (such as ordering custom stationery with her name and presumed title, as a power-hungry and egotistical character might do) will have gone to waste. In case you are a non-native/non-fluent English speaker, I'll clarify that the nameless lady probably does not literally believe the Baroness has ordered custom stationery. It's more a way of expressing cruel satisfaction that the Baroness will not be taking on the title of Queen. CANNOTANSWER",

The bullet hits Bond hard enough to blow him off a train into the river below, and everyone concludes that he died.  Later, Bond turns up alive and shirtless, sporting a shrapnel wound (which he is touching in the picture below) received from the bad guy -- but no apparent injury from the bullet that blew him off the train.   So where on his body did that bullet hit Bond? Or was Bond faking that the bullet hit him? (Bond was able to hear M order the shot, so maybe upon hearing, he was shocked enough and upset enough to fake like the bullet hit him and bail out of the situation - which seems consistent with his subsequent refusal to report in for duty, his descent into drunken abandon, and most importantly his apparent lack of bullet wound.)",

This shot leaves an entry wound and shrapnel. The second shot, that knocks Bond off the train, makes impact around his ribs on his right side. If Bond did have a bullet proof vest on, this area is likely to be covered. The impact from the bullet is transferred through the kevlar plate/s onto a larger area of Bonds body. Rather than penetrating his ribcage, and leaving an entry wound, the vest stops the bullet. Stopping the bullet before it enters his body imparts a lot more force onto Bond, which explains him being thrown off the train. It also explains the 4 broken ribs and minor organ damage. Bullet wounds are typically puncture wounds, deep and localised. Without a vest, Bond would have suffered much more serious organ damage as the bullet tears through him. Bullet proof vests typically leave blunt trauma injuries, affecting larger areas, and are not likely to leave scarring. One direct bullet wound is not likely to break 3 ribs, however the impact through a kevlar plate definitely is. CANNOTANSWER",

Bear in mind, in an early episode that Finch mentions how a series of almost totally unrelated facts are linked together by the Machine to determine the perpetrator of a crime. It doesn't take much if you can see and hear everything (and process it quick enough) to spot the connections. Perhaps it wasn't entirely conclusive, but nobody ever said that Samaritan insists on absolute proof before choosing an action. Once that connection was made, Samaritan could have analysed facial markers, his gait while walking, his voice records etc to achieve whatever level of proof it determined necessary to define Harold as a threat and to send its assets after him.

This question pretty much explains everything: Why did Nina Myers help Jack Bauer if she was a mole?  However, in episode 22, while Jack is being held hostage by the Drazens and Chapelle refuses to do anything about it, Nina unexpectedly calls Palmer and asks him to help save Jack.  Now, I really see no reason for her doing that! She can just let things happen and continue to do her job, her employer's plans are succeeding and Jack's killing was part of it.  Is there any consistent explanation as to why she would go out of her way when she obviously didn't have to?",

This new tracker having been put in place by the IMF and not the Parisian authorities that were holding Lane and trying to get him back from Hunt's team making not only Lane but Walker not realizing that Lane was still being tracked. I also believe they did this in order to set Lane's tracker as visible again and when they set the drone away with Lane's tracker to keep the authorities on a goose chase thinking that Lane was still on the move while Hunt's team escaped with Lane. When they finally set the drone free you can hear helicopters passing by overhead. They drew the authorities closer to the tracker and then set it free instead of them trying to follow them to the sewers. CANNOTANSWER",

      "background": "In spite of being corrupted, why has Mayor Quimby from The Simpsons not been replaced from the position of mayor yet. We have seen him taking bribes from Fat Tony, again some theft from tax money. So what is the reason that he is still the mayor of Springfield?  I know that he is largely just supposed to be funny, like many other characters that still have their jobs despite their incompetence (e.g. Chief Wiggum, Dr. Nick, Otto, ...). But apart from this, has it ever been adressed inside the show itself why Springfield fails to either recognize Quimby's inappropriateness for the job or do anything against it? Or is this left entirely unadressed as part of the joke around his character?",

As for the beneficial effects of the bath, I think the link to the \"Silkwood Shower\" reference by @Will-Feldman is probably as good an explanation as any. Try to get as much of the irradiated water off of the body as possible. John is obviously still going to be affected by his exposure, but there's no reason to allow more of the radiation to seep in if it can be prevented. CANNOTANSWER",

He seems to feel inferior to other senior partners like Jessica and Harvey (especially Harvey). He feels insecure about himself and lacks self-confidence.   Why does he have this \"inferior\" psychological issue, given that he was revealed to be the richest person in the law firm despite holding a more junior position (watch Season 6 episode 1) compared to Harvey and Jessica? His bosses were somewhat embarrassed when they learnt how rich Louis was. Logically, his bosses should feel inferior and not him.

Louis was always recognized as good at his job but he was never part of the in crowd, and failed at the interoffice politics necessary to rise as quickly and be as prominent as Harvey. So Louis's personality made it hard for him to have the professional successes that Harvey enjoyed but that same personality made it easy for him to be a good financial steward. Harvey on the other hand was careless with the money he earned but his charisma allowed him to do better in the office politics of the firm leading to more professional success but a worse financial position than Louis. Overall depending on how you define winner or best either one of them could be worthy of those titles. You seem to view their balance sheet as the arbitrator of success, and not professional achievement in the form of being managing partner. In all reality Louis had enough money to maintain his lifestyle if he quit getting a paycheck, unlike Harvey. However, as portrayed in the show becoming managing partner and mastering the relevant politics to become the de facto leader was the holy grail. Harvey was always closer than Louis in attaining this goal, making Harvey the better man in terms of the show like it or not. CANNOTANSWER",

None of the monsters have any noses. Some have horns but no noses.  Except Sulley, he's the only character to have a full featured face.  There is the little pig in the poster that has a nose, but it could be argued that it's not a monster (more of a pet). This noseless trait exists in the original Monsters Inc film as well.  I'm wondering why Pixar separated the facial features so that only Sulley has a nose. What was the motivation behind this decision?  Once you notice it. It becomes clear that Pixar did this for a reason, but I can't figure out why.",

Surprisingly, he uses a special code to trigger sexual reactions in a woman and gets serviced by her! Persephone's envy leads her to give Neo and gang the Key Maker's location. The Oracle mentions Merovingian to be the oldest of them, a powerful program. No program other than the Oracle has the purpose to be human like. The fact that Merovingian and Persephone turn human-like is them exhibiting programmatic roguishness. Their initial purpose is not mentioned, but the period of love that Persephone mentions is when they went rogue. Merovingian controls the virtual afterlife through the train-man program. This is where exiled programs seek refuge. Though this is the current operation, perhaps in the beginning, Merovingian was created with the purpose of Programmatic Garbage Collection. Once a program has served its purpose it needs to be de-allocated from the computing resource pool. (Eg: JVM provided by Java has a Garbage Collector which does a clean up periodically).

But, it doesn't work at all.     Is this because of Stark's Arc Reactor countering the Cosmic powers somehow, because Stark is incorruptible (which doesn't make much sense), or possibly because simply he was touching the Arc Reactor and not Stark's flesh?  Either way, is there an explanation of why this did not work on Tony?",

It's something artful blossoming from humble origins (which is what Bing hopes Abi becomes, through the show, with his help) and a touch of humanity in a hi-tech existence. His speech near the end demonstrates how he yearns for the truth and how sick he is of fakery. The penguin he has in the end, though, is a more realistic, less crude sculpture that seems expensive. In my opinion, it's on one hand a symbol of Bing succumbing to the inescapable artifice of his world after choosing to harness his 'truth' just to sell more products, and on the other a reminder of the love and authenticity he lost in Abi - or perhaps his attempt to preserve them in his upgraded, wealthier life.

In order to reach the desidered effect, it has to be long and certainly not pleasant. The phone ring is not real, it's just in Noodles head and expresses the metaphorical ring of his guilty conscience, which is stirred in the opium den by the newspaper's headlines hovering over the photos of Max, Patsy and Cockeye that read \"Bootleggers trapped by Feds; Three Slain\". Noodles tries once again to obliterate the painful memory of his betrayal triggered by the newspaper by sucking greedily on the opium pipe, bu to no avail. The scene is also beautifully edited in reverse, thus the audience does really understand the meaning of the ringing phone only at the end of the sequence, when we see Noodles picking up the phone and calling the desk of Sergeant Halloran (we are only shown the nametag on his desk). When Halloran (or one of his agents) picks up, the ringing stops and is replaced by a deafening, high-pitched noise that forces Noodles to stand up, no matter the amount of opium smoked.

      "background": "My understanding of how the story in movies proceeds is that the writer builds up the expectation of the audience and then concludes it appropriately.   I did not see that in American History X. All throughout the movie, the story builds up the expectation that Edward Norton would do something about the Neo-Nazi group that he helped establish before he was sent to Chino.   However, the movie \"abruptly\" ends with the death of his younger brother. Although this might sound very subjective but this seemed like an improper ending to me. Of course I don't want to argue if you liked this ending or not. But I'd like to understand what this ending was supposed to tell us. Why did the movie end in such an unexpected way and how did this ending tie in with the rest of the movie's story and themes?",

The whole film is a series of escalations based on revenge; Derek and Danny lose their father and hate consumes them. They win a basketball game against the black gang (and their turf in the process) and the gang try and steal their fathers' truck as revenge, Derek kills them over it. But then Derek's arrest interrupts this pattern, he goes off to prison and with the help of Dr. Sweeney he realises the pattern of behaviour and does what he can to prevent it from going any further. Derek has his catharsis and becomes a different person, and tries to help Danny do the same. But the problem is the same hasn't happened to those that he's wronged; there are still people out there from the black gang who have lost friends and blame them both for it, and in the end Danny pays the price. It is much more poignant and reflective of real life in this way, after years of fighting it's not so simple to drop everything and get the happy ending Hollywood has taught us is waiting.

There is a scene where the Joker puts two bombs in two separate boats and gives the detonator to the boat owners. He claims that each boat can use the detonator to blow up the other boat, before the other boat does the same. Eventually, the time limit runs out and no boats explode, thus proving that Gotham is good and redeemable.  Now, I'm not sure if I imagined/dreamt/read somewhere that each boat had in fact its own detonator. If they pressed the button, they would blow themselves up, not the other boat. This would be an even larger twist on the game.  Is this actually real? Is this what happens in the comics or on the original Batman movie? Or did I just read this on some theory on the web?",

'You failed to kill the lawyer...' - I cannot remember how the rest of the line goes but the boat finale appears to come from a desire to repeat the exercise and Batman puts the emphasis on all of this in his final rebuke. The film also goes a long way to show that both sets of passengers specifically reject the opportunity to kill each other - even for self defence. If a comic source for this plot line does actually show this as a double - bluff then it is still irrelevant to what was actually said and shown in 'The Dark Knight'. CANNOTANSWER",

Whereas in the book he doesn't accept the letter directly from Napoleon and has no reason to believe it has anything to do with Napoleon.  To me having this scene at Elba was unnecessary (in more ways than one), it makes it hard to believe that he was just naive and does the meaning of his betrayal by Mondego and Danglars.   To put it in a more modern context, had a terrorist leader passed him a letter which was said to contain a letter to family but actually contained plans for an attack, then Mondego and Danglars would be considered heroes and Edmond's quest for revenge would not be justified.  So, can Edmond Dantès really be considered innocent of treason?",

      "background": "In the 2011 film Rise of the Planet of the Apes, there is a scene where Caesar escapes from the house, attacks the neighbor, and during that attack he bites the man's finger.    During that sequence, we can clearly see that he does not lose his finger, but it is bloody.   Was this a mistake in the film?  Every time I watch this film, and that scene comes up, it seems to me that Caesar bites off the mans finger. But in the next shot, he has his finger back.  Later in the film people are discussing if it's safe to continue to have Caesar in the house, and one person mentions the attack. If I remember correctly, it's stated that the neighbor lost his finger.  It seems like an important plot point, because the neighbor mentions that he's a pilot. So loosing a finger would be kind of a big deal for him.  What is the correct result of Caesar's attack? Or was there some kind of last minute change in the editing room to keep the finger.",

Sometimes it happens with humans too and it makes us want to catch that finger and twist it hard. (But we don't do that :)) It's a natural emotion that comes to our mind, sometimes. My opinion is that Caesar did not want to bite it off, he just wanted to bite hard on that finger. Hard enough to cause bleeding. One more possibility is that in his anger, he closed his jaws on the finger but when the man started crying in pain he may have controlled himself and let him go. About losing the finger - losing the finger doesn't necessarily mean getting it bitten off. Maybe Caesar chewed it in a manner that it was badly damaged and may be the doctors advice to cut it off later. CANNOTANSWER",

      "background": "I was watching America's Got Talent last night, and during the opening credits was struck by the number of executive producers listed. It seems to grow longer each year.  They are (from the official NBC site):  Executive producers: Simon Cowell, Cecile Frot-Coutaz, Ken Warwick, Jason Raff, and Georgie Hurford-Jones  Co-executive producers: Nikki Boella, James McKinlay, Tabitha Hanson-Obtulowicz  Executive in Charge of Production: Tiffany Hoss, Charlie Krestul  Now I understand Simon Cowell and Ceicle Frot-Coutaz. He is head of the production company SYCO TV, and she is the CEO of FremantleMedia North America, which produce the show. And Ken Warwick is an executive producer and showrunner for American Idol. (Not clear if he is is also a showrunner at AGT.)  But who are all these other seven EPs? None of them have entries in Wikipedia.  The executive producer entry in Wikipedia indicates there can be several types of executive producer: traditional EPs (production executives, financiers, etc.), head writer(s), and showrunner(s).  I can't see how there could be more than one head writer -- host Nick Cannon is the only one that appears to have a script. AGT is making a ton of money, so it wouldn't seem there would need to be a lot of investors.  Do they really need ten chefs in the kitchen?",

Stan Lee, for example, has done it for so long now that it's expected and many fans get enjoyment out of spotting him in each of his roles. The same applies to Hitchcock. After the fun and tradition reasons, it's certainly plausible to suggest because they can. Many directors don't have the fame or recognition for a cameo role to be significant. But if someone like Tarantino, Scorcese or Peter Jackson does it, it's instantly recognisable given their fame. This can be compared to other, less famous, directors who wouldn't be recognised. Therefore, it certainly carries that making cameos gives them airtime and keeps them recognisable in the public eye. These are just a few of the reasons. I'm sure other arguments could be made, such as the fact it saves money (such as in the case of a longer role, e.g. Tarantino in Django), but it seems to be mostly about a mixture of fun and tradition.

Where did you learn the litany of spells required to even understand it?      Dr. Strange:      I've got a photographic memory. It's how I got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time.

Fact: Agamotto constructed the necklace to house the time stone, and while he was a powerful sorcerer (the first Sorcerer Supreme), he was still a mortal. Speculation: He was simply out of his depth. He was able to build a construct capable of housing and tapping in to the power of the time-stone, but was unaware or unable to tap into the full power of the stone effortlessly. The necklace required rigorous study of very specific spell-casting because that is how it was designed. Fact: Thanos had the gauntlet purpose-built to house all 6 stones and access their powers easily. Speculation: He is able to access their powers so easily because he is aware of what each stone is capable of (hence why he is looking for them) and had Eitri the dwarf design the gauntlet to fully access those capabilities.

The Night King arrives at the place and changes it with his touch. If we look at the scene from S0803 closely, it was dark. Night King was going towards Bran. Arya came running and suddenly jumps towards Night King. He senses the movement and sound and grabs Arya by her neck by reflex. So, the intention was to stop and kill her. When Arya drops the dagger, Night King looks surprised. This shows he doesn't know what would happen next. There was no time to think and turn her into a white walker by touch. There was no planning in this scene like S04E04. First intent is to stop and kill Arya. We do not know what would he do if he killed her. Even if he had so much time, it's unclear whether Night King can turn adults directly into white walkers. It's neither hinted in the show or books. When he holds Arya, we hear a cracking sound of ice. Arya was quick enough to react, drop the dagger and do the rest. CANNOTANSWER",

      "background": "While reading his wiki page it says that: Running alongside his enthusiasm for DVD, Scott is sometimes considered the \"father\" of the director's cut, though the impetus to produce such versions has sometimes begun with other parties. The positive reaction to the Blade Runner Director's Cut encouraged Scott to re-cut several movies that were a disappointment at the time of their release (including Legend and Kingdom of Heaven). Today the practice of alternative cuts is more commonplace, though often as a way to make a film stand out in the DVD marketplace by adding new material.  Blade Runner was his first Director's cut but he has made many since. It seems he has the most Director's Cut Editions. Also it seems that he does a lot of Director Cut because his movies are changed by studio input after test screenings. So does his making of so many Director's Cut actually hurt the movies ( since the original movie is no longer the definitive version) or help them by creating more layers?",

An alternate (possibly revisionist) version of a movie cannot detract from the original viewing experience, it can only add an additional positive (or negative) experience. In the case of Ridley and Blade Runner, I have every version, and his “Final Cut” is my favorite, and I am pleased-giddy that he was able to get yet another version released. It is my opinion that, given 4+ versions, you have the luxury of choosing the one you enjoy most. You have nothing but upside! Any downside is for pessimists, or people who have undue hatred for capitalist who play their little games – while we are still free to play ours. In the case of his refusal to agree to a Director's Cut of Prometheus – that is cool too. I enjoy the fact that as an artist Ridley Scott wraps his arms fully around the meta concept of additional releases, and indeed incorporates that into the overall art – like Claude Monet's Water Lilies, or Haystacks – as long as HE is making the decisions. (You might argue the opposite for 99% of all other director/studio combos.) CANNOTANSWER",

This often includes disorientation re: space and time, for example, in Planet of the Apes the planet turns out to be Earth, after the title implies some other world. Babylon A.D. also has a stop-short quality: if it doesn't quite make sense, that's the point. \"Babylon\" usually refers to the distant past or, as you say, the generic sense. \"A.D.\" is both final and futuristic, not what we expect, this is neither the historical Babylon nor a generic reference. (If \"C.E.\" is gradually being adopted, that adds to the effect.) Playfully bewildering titles aren't uncommon in fantastic films. One I've found intriguing is the U.S. title for Quatermass and the Pit (1967): Five Million Years to Earth. A few years later came Dracula A.D. 1972, and The X-Files did \"Hollywood A.D.\" Thus, \"Babylon A.D.\" seems less a plot reference (I haven't seen it) than an appeal to the tastes and cultural memory of s.f. viewers.

So, I'm not sure if the trailer fits into the chronology at all. So, what is the deal with the trailer?

After watching the movie, two things were stuck in my head about these two characters, Théo (Louis Garrel) and Isabelle (Eva Green). 1 - They both share common interest, that's passion for movies. Through out the movie you see snippets of french classic movies (that's what I think they are.) and they role-play them and they lay bets on those movies. 2 - At any cost, they don't leave each other. The movie made me say this line because, from beginning, they sleep nude next to each other, they bath together and even sexuality (the intercourse between Isabelle and Matthew in the kitchen.) they took liberally. So, I'm not surprised that Isabelle did not choose to leave with Matthew. Simply, Isabelle won't either leave her twin brother or the love for movies. CANNOTANSWER",

Initially i thought that they are good old friends and hence Mr White was devastated. But that is not the case and they met only a few weeks prior to this incident. In one scene Mr White whispers something in Mr Orange ear and they giggle.   There are many other scenes like White combing Orange's hair, Mr Orange removing his wedding ring before meeting White and the most intimate and emotional scene was the climax scene.

That's almost indisputable. However I never interpreted it that way when I watched it, I just assumed it was simply the building of a mutual respect, and a mentor/mentee relationship. However, as the article goes on to say that their relationship is similar to “wakashudo”, and knowing Tarantino's affinity with samurai culture (which he made 2 films about) it is very possible that this is the relationship dynamic he intended to portray. Of course, like most movies, it is open to interpretation. Therefore whilst the subtext is certainly there, and it was almost certainly intended that way by the writer/director, it is also subtle enough so that it doesn't necessarily force the audience to interpret the movie that way.

      "background": "In the iconic Battle of Stirling Bridge scene in the film Braveheart, English heavy cavalry knights charge with a lance in their right hand and a shield in their left hand.   I recently watch this battle scene again and noticed one particular thing: English knights should have carried close quarter melee weapons.   I understand for heavy cavalry, they are supposed to charge towards their enemy over and over again on their horses, but should they not consider taking a melee weapon with them, for example, a mace, a sword or a dagger so that they can defend themselves when they become dismounted.   I think it is a detail Mel Gibson overlooked when making this movie.",

Any sheathed weapons, such as swords, would be on the shield side for a crossdraw, and thus away from the camera angle. There is one shot from a falling horse late in the scene where the hilt of a sheathed sword becomes briefly visible. Whether this sword is strapped to the horse (a common means of keeping secondary weapons), or belongs to one of the Scots on the ground, is difficult to determine. On the other hand, non-sheathed weapons such as maces, warhammers and battleaxes tended to be attached via a strap to the belt or trousers on the right hand side. These were common secondary weapons for knights, and we should be able to see some of them in the scene, but none are visible. Chances are you are correct, and these weapons were not included as part of the cavalry equipment. Most likely this was done to reduce the cost of filming. After all, the knights get slaughtered in the scene and we don't see any scenes where they get to fight back after falling from their horses, so these weapons are redundant from a filming standpoint.

He simply needed to tell her what an amazing adventure they just experienced, though knowing that she certainly didn't experience it at all, which is also the reason why he smiles, trying to find the words to convice her of all they've been through, just this time under a happier premise. And in fact he had just seen her die, so first of all, he needed to make sure she was still alive, even if knowing it. CANNOTANSWER",

It was only in the second TV movie, \"Wine, Women, and War\" that he was changed to have the rank of Colonel. I have not read the Martin Caidin novels, but evidently he held the military rank and background in those.  Is there any evidence in writings about the pilot regarding what scenarios would be possible in future TV movies, shows (if they were already pitching it as a series) if he didn't have the military background? It seems as though they deemed it important in the initial pilot movie that Steve Austin was well-known as an astronaut, but was the cultural backdrop of the end of the Vietnam war part of their initial decision to shed the military connection?",

The US military was not held in high regards in many circles and having Austin be a veteran might have been seen as \"problematic.\" The pilot seems to have done away with this by having Austin be a civilian test pilot who was the only civilian ever sent to the Moon. After two additional television films (during which Steve Austin was returned to his former military rank) the series was picked up by ABC as a weekly series in 1974. The improbability of Austin having been a civilian astronaut was probably brought the attention of the producers who simply changed the back story during the second pilot film. In this respect, the television series began to match Martin Caidin's novels. The show later expanded upon Austin's background adding a family and then later love interest, Jamie Sommers, who herself became The Bionic Woman. CANNOTANSWER",

Quoting from the script:   When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in   babytalk.   FABIENNE  I was looking at myself in the mirror.   BUTCH  Uh-huh?   FABIENNE  I wish I had a pot.   BUTCH  You were lookin' in the mirror and   you wish you had some pot?   FABIENNE  A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are   sexy.   BUTCH  Well you should be happy, 'cause you   do.   FABIENNE  Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot!   I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna   when she did \"Lucky Star,\" it's not   the same thing.   BUTCH  I didn't realize there was a   difference between a tummy and a pot   belly.   FABIENNE  The difference is huge.   BUTCH  You want me to have a pot?   FABIENNE  No. Pot bellies make a man look either   oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a   woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The   rest of you is normal. Normal face,   normal legs, normal hips, normal   ass, but with a big, perfectly round   pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a   tee-shirt two sizes too small to   accentuate it.   BUTCH  You think guys would find that   attractive?   FABIENNE  I don't give a damn what men find   attractive. It's unfortunate what we   find pleasing to the touch and   pleasing to the eye is seldom the   same.   BUTCH  If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in   it.   FABIENNE  You'd punch me in my belly?   BUTCH  Right in the belly.   FABIENNE  I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your   right on your face 'til you couldn't   breathe.   BUTCH  You'd do that to me?   FABIENNE  Yes!   I am not a native English speaker and thus not familiar with the usual contexts in which the term pot belly is used.  Fabienne and Butch are obviously fooling around (as is indicated by the initial direction in the script), but I was wondering whether there was a hidden meaning to this particular section of dialogue. Is Fabienne asking Butch if he wants to have a baby with her?",

After rewatching the film, I decided that she probably was, and that was part of the point of seeing those scenes. I then decided to look up what the name Fabienne means, because of the theory that all the names in Pulp Fiction mean something, except for Esmarelda the Cab driver, who tells us that all names mean something. Fabienne is a female version of the Roman family name Fabius, which means 'Bean Grower'. Pregnant. CANNOTANSWER",

Ivy Walker (who is blind) needs to breach the borders and go into the woods. It is revealed to her by her father that the creatures actually do not exist, but they were simply used as a scare tactic to prevent the villagers from venturing into the woods and going to \"the towns.\"  Ivy still wears her yellow cloak. She falls into a hole and gets her yellow cloak covered with mud.

While extremely distrustful of him to begin with because of Jesse, Gus takes a risk and accepts Walt into his trade and even gives him the lab at the behest of Gale encouraging Gus that purity means more money. Assuming everything went smoothly and certain events didn't occur, it is plausible that even after learning Walt's connection to Hank that it would still be beneficial to Gus to keep him on as long as he survived due to the extra money Gus could make and the monetary incentive for Walt. Judging by the series as a whole, Gus only intended death for Walt after he ran over his dealers, breaking the peace to save Jesse's life, who was still considered a lowly junkie by Gus.

Ricin is a chemical subject to the Chemical Weapons Convention, in the same schedule as nerve agents Sarin and VX. (All this information gleaned from Wikipedia) Walt also only told her when she'd already begun to experience symptoms, so less likely to recover even if treated. Even if she sought attention and gave them this information it seems unlikely that she would recover. Even if she's not been given a lethal dose, survivors of ricin often suffer from long term organ damage, so she would have a pretty miserable and presumably shortened life even if she does survive. I think Walt probably weighed her slim improved chances of survival, against the pleasure of knowing that she was aware who had done this to her.

It is implied to be the same Ace chemical factory that the Joker is said to have fall in to make him as pale green as we know him. The significance of the scene is to establish that Joker maybe somehow also actually cared about Harley instead of just toying with her. His face before jumping down seems to show some internal conflict, as of he himself disliked that he felt something for her, which pushed him to save her against his normal desire to kill people. It's also to establish how Harley became like she did, her look. That she voluntarily became like that, out of a type of mad love for Mistah J. Unlike her recent comic reboot where he threw her into the acid against her will. The comics make him rapier than the movie. Then again, as this is a flashback of an \"unreliable narrator\" like batshit crazy Harley, we don't know if that's an accurate flashback. For one, she wouldn't have been able to see what Joker does after she fell. Line of Sight issues. CANNOTANSWER",

Before he does so the two men from the Basterds leave the auditorium and proceed to some side corridors to get to the side balcony and attack Hitler. Some time after they leave the auditorium Marcelle comes to the doors and blocks them. The balcony where Hitler sits with Himmler has a separate door guarded by two German soldiers. The two Basterds kill the guards, rush into the balcony and shoot Hitler. Right after that the \"message\" appears and Marcelle sets the pile of films behind the screen on fire. So the balcony doors are not blocked - Hitler likely can escape the theater or at least gain some time and space and have better chances to have been resqued. He definitely has much better chances than those people who are in the auditorium - those are blocked between the locked doors and bursting flames - but he is at least not in the auditorium and so less exposed to the dangers and has a chance to use the side corridors to escape. The two Basterds shooting him on the balcony make that totally impossible. CANNOTANSWER",

However, if one looks at how he was wounded it is conceivable that he wouldn't have died from the wound that he received and that he simply became unconscious at the end of the episode. While an M-60 fires a 7.62 (.30 cal) round, its bullets are copper jacket military rounds. These rounds don't expand and often inflict non-fatal wounds if they don't strike major organs or blood vessels. As demonstrated in the episode \"Felina\", the series denouement, Walter isn't struck directly by a rounds but is hit by a ricochet. This could cause a serious injury and perhaps an incapacitating one; however death seems to be a stretch. Assuming that Walt's injury (on his lower right side) could have struck his liver or his renal artery and thus caused him to bleed out internally. Unfortunately, such a wound would have made it impossible for him to have walked out of the neo-Nazi's hideout and around for what would have been at least ten minutes. Given that the police shown to have arrived within seconds of Walt's collapse, he could have easily been saved if paramedics had been called. The series states that Walter White is dead.

Possible explanations include the T-Rex's ambushing skills (as evident in the earlier Gallimimus chasing scene), the afore-mentioned distraction of the Velociraptors, or even a huge suspension of disbelief to better serve the dynamism of the scene.

The name came from the fact that it used to be the second movie of a double-bill, and was usually low budget and shorter than the other. Nowadays we think of a B-Movie in a broader sense of being a low budget commercial movie, and has some overlap with Exploitation movies, but they can cover multiple genres including Horror as you mention. Science Fiction & Westerns are genres that have produced many B-Movies. The Italians were famous for producing 'Peplum' movies - also known as 'Swords and Sandals' movies. It is true that there was a 'golden age' of B-Movies and that there are certain traits that might make you think 'this is a b-movie', but I do not think they would form a recognized genre in their own right. Yes, director's would often know they were making a B-Movie - explicitly because it had a low budget and was destined to accompany a main feature. This might impart some of the characteristics that people love or hate about B-Movies, but it doesn't make it a genre IMHO. CANNOTANSWER",

The other powered characters in that scene were the various \"old gods\". At least three of them are credited. Besides Zeus, we also see Ares (same actor as Wonder Woman) and Artemis (who is probably the bow wielder you're thinking of, if I had to guess.) In the DC universe, there are a dozen or so Olympian gods, all of which would likely have been present. I will point out that Steppenwolf uses the phrase \"old gods\" to describe Wonder Woman's heritage, but in a way that's generally not the same as it's used in the DC comics universe. Zeus, Ares, etc. in the comics are the gods of Olympus, and would be classified as \"New Gods\" in the same vein as Darkseid. Steppenwolf appears to use the term just to describe the gods of the old world, not referring to the beings actually called the \"Old Gods\". CANNOTANSWER",

She controlled time itself and wrapped it around him, giving him life with a power that she didn't understand. Imagine it as someone who has a prosthetic limb and needs to learn to control it. She tried to place something (his life) gently back into time and instead punched out violently. Time around him solidified as if it were that paste that goes solid with kinetic energy. She made it so that his death was something that just couldn't happen, wrapping him in time energy that jumpstarts his system whenever he dies, almost like an antivirus seeking out a problem with a program and fixing it. Of course, over time that energy would wear down and eventually dissipate, in this case by his own choice which allowed him to finally die. Exposure to time travellers would likely drain some of the energy too, as would the vortex he guarded in Torchwood. It never got explained but I like to think that the whole Face of Boe thing came about due to cellular mutations introduced in his system over the course of millions of reconstitutions over the years. Having the effect turn off (like it did in Miracle Day, for example) every so often would allow him to be mutated from radiation enough that over centuries he could become as he was when he died.

The lightning tree introduces (naturally, without raising the suspicions of anyone else) the element of controlled, predictable burst of electricity in a pre-designated location, which obviously is of benefit to Beetee. Furthermore, it is a clear and concise way for the tributes to keep track of what time it is, even if they aren't anywhere near the section that is enduring it's 'hour'. It's the equivalent of Big Ben striking 12. It's never pro-filmically shown that Beetee had discussed a plan with Heavensbee beforehand, but it's interesting that Beetee is insistent on carrying around that spool of electrical wire throughout most of the film.

He says farewell to Bloom, that he shouldn't ever return to St. Petersburg and cannot see him for some time. But already shortly after, when he is driving in the car with Penelope, Bloom realizes that the blood was indeed real blood and that his brother is in fact dead.  Yet when he sits in the grass crying over his brother, he repeats what Stephen once said:    The perfect con is one where everyone involved gets just the thing they wanted.    seeming appeased and walking into a future with Penelope.  The way he says that and seeing that Penelope is most probably the thing Bloom wanted and vice-versa seems to imply that Stephen also got what he wanted (and thus achieved the perfect con), yet he died. So what did Bloom want to say with that quote? Does this mean that Stephen really wanted to die? But why?",

He tells about his brother's dream to do the perfect con, about making the made-up story true, and how he thinks Stephen might have even liked it to have died at midnight on a beach during a trip to Jakarta as that would be something \"real\". Bloom then tells Penelope that it is a trap to try to make your own story true. Dying for his brother, to complete the story, does fit into this pattern. Stephen says that it was always only about Bloom, and it is certainly not a coincidence that Bloom is the one who is called by the Family name; he is the main person of the movie. Stephen is the creator of a story for his brother; his job is done at the end of the movie. Of course that is an explanation that only works in movies; in reality stories and lives rarely have fixed and clear starts and ends. The death of a character in a movie is a clear symbol that his part is completed. The character in this movie served a single purpose, to care for the happiness of his brother; by making the story real he spares the couple to start their relationship on a lie. CANNOTANSWER",

The one that makes the most sense is that Gus poisoned Brock so that Jesse would kill Walt out of anger. From Gus' point of view, this is ideal as Jesse was the one holding Gus back from killing Walt — If Jesse himself kills Walt then this is out of the question. Now, for this constructed fantasy to work, when Jesse comes to Walt's house, he must have the opportunity to kill Walt.

How did the main computer realize that? I mean, there were totally a lot of copies of agent Smith, and it could be links that were linking to the main object (real Agent Smith). Or maybe they were independent copies?  They absolutely weren't pointers, because insurance from 1 example hadn't influence on the original.  So how did the computer accomplish this?",

The primary difference in the end was that Neo was hardwired to the source and not jacked in from a regular pod or an illegal back door entry. When Smith assimilated on Neo, the machines get a hold of Smith's replication programming. This enables them to target and destroy the Smith program which causes the replication to be undone across the Matrix. In short, Smith had turned into a replicating worm which the machines couldn't get a lock on until the replication occurred on an entity (Neo) connected directly from the source. CANNOTANSWER",

Also Owen mentioned in a scene that    Owen: She has seen all of this for the first time. She doesn't   know what she is? She'll kill everything that moves.     Owen: She is learning where she fits in the food chain.   And these lines were true until the Indominus met the Velociraptors. It didn't eat them, it started communication with them. But strangely before that it ate her sibling.  Okay now one explanation can be that part of its genes were Velociraptor, so it communicated with them and eating the sibling was just her hunger.

The T-Rex is a doer, not a thinker; brute not brain. The Indominus is also hyper intelligent, perhaps moreso than the raptors themselves.

He accepts this and moves on, and we see him meet another potential love interest. Changed by his experience, he has the confidence to talk to her.    However, I recently watched the movie on Netflix (Canada), and it had a different ending:    Walter asks Cheryl to see his sister's Grease play, and Cheryl says yes. They are seen holding hands after they see that Walter is the \"Quintessence of Life\", and the movie then ends.   The ending I saw on Netflix can be seen here.  Am I confusing this with a different movie? Is the Mandela-Berenstain effect at play here? Or did the Blu-ray contain a different ending (or perhaps multiple endings) compared to what Netflix is showing?  Google has been no help, as most of the search results are about people writing alternate endings for school assignments.",

Finding an answer is proving to be difficult because even after trying numerous search-term permutations, I only managed to find a single mention of the discrepancy.  I can understand if maybe they wanted to focus on the emotion and stuff of the episode, but it's a science-fiction show, and this was one of the first incidents of time-travel in the whole franchise, so getting back is a fairly big issue that can't just be glossed over.",

How did Kirk, Spock, and McCoy go through the portal in the first place? They jumped. They jumped in, McCoy first, followed by Kirk and Spock. They came back in the same manner, only Spock and Kirk come back first because they entered the timeline first. The jumping motion was one contiguous motion as seen from the crew left on the planet.

Howards mother is essentially a charicature of an overbearing, overprotective, troubled but caring, single-parent.

They even \"converted\" Hydra scientists, like Arnim Zola, whom in turn decided to poison SHIELD from the inside. By 2010s, Hydra agents were everywhere, from low level rank and file, special agents (Jasper Sitwell), elite soldiers (STRIKE team leader Brock Rumlow), the World Security Council (Alexander Pierce), and even senators (Senator Stern, the prick from Iron Man). These two factors combined, would have meant SHIELD either intentionally set up to study the Leviathan for further benefit, or Hydra intercepted it, as they did the Scepter in the Winter Soldier stinger. It's highly likely that the Hydra base was a black site bankrolled by SHIELD until it collapsed. CANNOTANSWER",

Indy learns this when he and Sallah have the head piece translated...don't know why this was left out of the movie...bad dates, maybe.

They have seen Jon by her side when she's standing on King's Landing steps and proclaiming her victory and further conquest. So they know he is a close ally to her.

Afterward, when the film was such a success that they were asked to write a script for a sequel, they regretted writing this scene the way that they did, because Doc and Marty brought Jennifer along, which limited their options in writing the next script. If it has just been Doc and Marty, they could have made the next movie about anything they wanted, the two guys on any crazy adventure in time.

      "background": "I recently re-watched \"Lost\" in its entirety for the first time since the show ended. Overall, I appreciated the show, and especially seasons 4-6, a great deal more now than I did during my initial watch. Now I also see that most questions were answered, even though some questions are still left for debate.  One question that I do wish the producers had given a more satisfactory answer to, though, is the connection between Eloise Hawking and MIB's loophole. When Locke leaves the island, he is told by Christian Shephard (i.e. MIB), to find Eloise Hawking in Los Angeles. Eloise is then later paramount in ensuring that the loophole works in that she is insisting that the coffin with Locke's body must be on board the Ajira-flight, thus providing MIB with his \"vessel\" for completing the loophole. These two facts made me think that perhaps Eloise somehow was cooperating with MIB, but this is never really confirmed, and since we know that MIB can not leave the island, this means that MIB must have \"recruited\" Eloise before she left the island. But if this is the case, how could MIB know about his loophole-plan years before it manifested? Does MIB perhaps have contact with somebody else off the island who could relay information to Eloise? Or is it perhaps possible that Eloise really had no contact with MIB, and simply insisted Locke's body had to be on the Ajira-flight in order to have a \"substitue\" for Christian Shephard's body which was on Oceanic 815? Or was she somehow manipulated by MIB without her knowledge through some way never seen on the show?   I really do not find a satisfactory answer to this, so I would love to hear some theories from other people here!",

The 'loophole' was part of MIB's years in the making plan to escape the island, and as such MIB would have provided Eloise/The Others with pieces of the plan that they needed to contribute to. The Others have reliable ways of communicating and traveling to/from the Island. That's the (admittedly off-camera, and not fully explained in the show) way that she would know of the need to have Locke on the plane. However, she was also responsible for getting Desmond onto the Island originally. In the final season it was revealed that Desmond was part of a plot that Widmore and Hawking enacted to kill the MIB. Desmond's ability to survive exposure to large amounts of electromagnetism was used to get him to the heart of the Island, where he temporarily disabled the MIB's immortality. So presumably Eloise took orders from the MIB. But also, at some point (likely after realizing she'd shot her own time-traveling son), she started enacting a plan to kill the MIB. Widmore worked with her on this, although he likely started contributing later, as he was working to dethrone Linus until pretty late in the show. CANNOTANSWER",

      "background": "In the film Patriot Games starring Harrison Ford, the terrorist group uses someone inside the police department to obtain the route & arrangements for Sean Miller's transfer. A few lines and glances by Inspector Robert Highland (played by David Threlfall), riding in the van, seem to indicate that he is on Sean's side, or at least understands the IRA cause with the following lines:    Although I disapprove of the things ye've done, Sean, I can't quite  bring meself to condemn ya. I can't... because I understand where the  hatred comes from. I more than understand it.   When the van comes under siege, the officers don't seem to know what's going on, while Highland just keeps looking at Sean as if they both know exactly what's happening. The two officers then wish to hold out for backup, yet Highland orders them to open the doors. During the discussion afterwards, group leader Kevin O'Donnell seems to believe that Highland is an honest cop, asking him how much the English pay him to turn on his own people (Highland is Irish). O'Donnell then hands a gun to Sean Miller and    Miller promptly executes both Highland and the two officers that were in the van.   I haven't read the book, so I'm not sure about the nuanced context here. The lines may simply be Highland attempting to turn Miller so that he'll testify against the rest of his group, but the glances between them - and the actions of Highland himself - don't really make as much sense in that context. Surely the book would explain such details better than the film.  Was Inspector Highland their man inside (and his fate was only to show how insane Miller is) or was he an honest cop?   And, yes, I realize that a different inside man was revealed at the end of the movie. That doesn't preclude the Inspector being one also, though, or at least an IRA sympathizer/mole. Highland's fate also foreshadows that of     terrorist ally Dennis Cooley, who is also executed by Miller.",

In the book version of events, Highland did not know about the schedule or route - they were picked by Commander Owens. Highland also did not have the conversation with Miller, and he survived the rescue despite being shot, remaining in critical condition with the bullet lodged near his spine.

Tyrion: So what happens to her? Please ... don't ...    Varys: I have spoken as honestly as I can. Each of us has a choice to make. I pray we choose wisely.

Part of the way the Strangers keep the human populous from suspecting they are part of an experiment is to keep them from realizing that fact. So, they implant them with memories of being outside the city, in the daylight, to keep them docile. Shell Beach, in particular, represents hope. Without the belief that there is something better just outside the city, the humans would likely go mad with the realization that they are stuck in an elaborate prison. Of course, since there is no actual Shell Beach, they keep the memories vague, so that everyone thinks they know where it is, but can't give clear directions. Nobody questions this because they've all been programmed by the Strangers not to -- until John Murdock comes along. John Murdock knows there's something wrong with the city, and his partial memory implant gives him glimpses of Shell Beach, which he latches onto as a means of unraveling the mysteries of the city. John lacks the programming to accept things as they are, and his questions eventually lead Bumstead, who has been programmed to be a detective, to join him. He is, in essence, looking for hope, and in the end, he must create it himself. CANNOTANSWER",

Most likely they were signing the rights to the recording over to the station owner in exchange for a quick payment. The \"band\" themselves had no idea they were popular until they sang at Stoke's fund raiser, as evidence by the claim that \"no one will believe we're a real band\", and the shock at the crowd's reaction to their song. We don't have any idea what happened to them after the end of the movie, but it would be reasonable to expect they eventually got signed to a record contract. The governor would probably have wanted them to keep recording music, if nothing else, so he could continue to ride their popularity. That contract would have covered any future recordings; it's also possible they could negotiate royalties for future sales of their hit song, and the station owner would cave in to keep them happy. But that's just speculation, since the last we know of the boys they're going to go work for the governor. CANNOTANSWER",

They discover the location of LV-223 and get the support from Weyland to fund a scientific trip. It is entirely coincidental that they are in a relationship, though of course that fact is used later in the plot. They are a couple on the ship because they are responsible for the expedition. The situation in Alien Covenant is entirely different. This is a colonization ship, a deliberate, one-way trip to settle on another planet. It is clearly deliberate that the ship is (entirely?) crewed by couples who are likely to want to settle and raise families in their destination. I don't think you can extrapolate the second example to say it is 'encouraged officially'. Its clearly encouraged, possibly a requirement for the people funding a colonization of another planet, but why would it be a general requirement?

The movie is really good, but I could not understand one thing - the fantasy part with Ofelia, is it happening for real or she is just imagining things?  I ask this because I noted two points in the movie -   When Vidal pulls the mandrake root out of Ofelia's mother's bed it appears to be just a normal root. While whenever Ofelia is seen with it, it does things. In the end when Vidal follows Ofelia to the labyrinth, Ofelia is talking to the faun, but when Vidal looks at it, it appears that there is no one there.   So what's exactly happening? Is Ofelia just dreaming things to get herself in a fairy world, out of her present surroundings or the things happening for real but visible only to Ofelia?",

In a final splurge of communication, done as the scientists start to panic about the reaction of the other nations to the partial communications they have interpreted, the aliens send a very rich message: not one word but a whole screenful of words. Nobody can make sense of it until Louise has a moment of insight and can read it all and get the point of it. Only at this moment does the full intent of the language have an effect on her: and when it does it rewrites her sense of time. She then uses this knowledge of the future to avert a potential catastrophe. We only see the implications of this in the postscript (which may be actually her memory of the future) where many of the players meet for the first time at a celebration of her book on the language and one of them triggers her memory of what she did to talk down the hostility. The key point is that she is the first person to completely grasp the alien language and therefore the first to experience its ability to undo her brain's sense of linear time. CANNOTANSWER",

The ninth Doctor absorbed the vortex energy from Rose and the tenth Doctor absorbed the radiation from that completely weird and odd failsafe containment thingy. Neither of them regenerated by choice. Also keep in mind that timespans are hardly constant when comparing single episodes. While this is especially true for time travelling stuff, it's also true for pretty much any other TV series or movie (maybe except 24). For example, take episodes such as Rose or Aliens of London. The story happening in those essentially covers a day or two each. Compare this to episodes with far longer timespans, e.g. The Impossible Astronaut and the sequel: Those cover several months. Or, if you want it even more time bending: Blink happens on a single day for the audience as well as for the characters depicted in the present.

      "background": "In episode 10 of season 2 we witness the encounter between one of the Night King's \"officer\" and Samwell Tarly.       However, since then, Samwell had time to make it back to the wall, meet Gilly and her child, leave the night's watch, travel it to the Citadel, study to become a Maester, leave the citadel etc.   Now, even after all this time, we see in episode 6 of season 7 that the army of the dead has not even reached the wall yet. Considering the fact that the army of the dead is made out of undeads who don't need (or at least I don't think so) to frequently stop to eat or rest, I was wondering how they haven't made it to the wall yet.   I thought that they maybe could've been retained from heading to the wall by the some of the 3 eyed raven's magic, but even then, Bran had the time to make it back to the wall by being pulled by a young girl on a sled.   I feel like I am completely missing out on some basic plot hole and that this question is actually super easy to explain but unfortunately, I truly cannot recall any events that could explain this.  Edit: Regarding the accusations of this question being a duplicate of (Why is the Night King so slow?). From what I understood, that other question was addressing more precisely why the night king ACTS as slow as he does, notably in ep6 of season 7 when he attacks Viserion. My question is more looking at why it took the night king more or less 5 seasons for him to reach the wall while Samwell did it in barely 1. I researched before posting this question and unfortunately that other question did not answer at all what I am asking here...",

In particular, there were times when levitating herself would have been very useful, such as when she needed Vision to fly her out of the train car as Slokovia fell. However, Wanda's major character development during the course of the movie is that she starts out, under Ultron's guidance, as a misguided villain, until her time spend with the rest of the Avengers eventually redeems her. You will notice that, during the first half of the movie, she almost exclusively uses her mental manipulation power. It's only after she starts spending time with people like Captain America and Hawkeye that she starts to embrace her other powers, like stopping the train, or using hex-bolts on Ultron clones. It seems likely that the Avengers have been helping her explore her abilities, and become better at using them. It may be as simple as her not knowing she could levitate until someone else convinced her to try. CANNOTANSWER",

Maw makes it clear that it is the children of Thanos that have come to take the stone. This is further clarified in the ship when Strange is held by the surgical needles. Therefore, the answer that he thought Maw was Thanos at any point in time is definitely not correct. The correct answer could be that he thought the GOTG were somehow Thanos initially, but Strange is a smart guy and none of those people are even remotely Thanos, plus Thanos had already sent Maw after him who proclaimed as mentioned above that the children of Thanos essentially do all his work for him, so he probably thought that they were WITH Thanos. This makes more sense anyway as the general conversation goes when Spidey is caught by Starlord at gunpoint; i.e. \"we're the Avengers man!\" Therefore, this answer is also likely not correct (although closer to correct than the top answer). The only answer I can come up with is that Strange is breaking the 4th wall, something that a master of the mystic arts could possibly do, and is referring to Cable. This would be well-within the realm of the self-deprecating humor of Deadpool and acceptable to Marvel, because they would want to maintain that Brolin was always Thanos and not Cable. CANNOTANSWER",

      "title": "Why did the Great Gasby (2013) movie erase the hints of Nick Carraway's homosexuality?",
      "background": "This question is about the two-oscar winning movie Great Gastby (2013) that was co-written and directed by Baz Luhrmann.   Only after I had seen this extraordinary movie and found out that F. Scott Fitzgerald's greatest work \"The Great Gastby\" has been translated into a film five times did I decide to finally read the novel.  But the novel story turned out to be very different.  Tobey Maguire played Nick Carraway as a guileless heterosexual, but in the novel, his sexuality's a bit ambiguous:    \"Come to lunch someday,\" [Mr. McKee] suggested, as we groaned down in the elevator.    \"Where?\"     \"Anywhere.\"     \"Keep your hands off the lever,\" snapped the elevator boy.     \"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. McKee with dignity, \"I didn't know I was touching it.\"    \"All right,\" I agreed, \"I'll be glad to.\"    . . . I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.   Why would the great author Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald bother to include this strange passage, silly Nick in bed with the feminine Mr. McKee in his underwear at 3AM? If not to show some signs of Nick's sexual orientation, what other purpose could it possibly serve?   In the book, Nick meets Mr. McKee at a party and goes home with him. In the film, director Luhrmann made him go to the party, and made him ending up cuddling (or most likely) having sex with a woman.   Furthermore, in the movie, Nick is first attracted to Gatsby's parties by a glimpse of a lovely young woman. He seemed visibly affected by the sensuality of Myrtle Wilson. In the book, he recognizes her appeal, but showed revulsion and profound disapproval; later he was sneering at her \"artificial laughter.\"  The film decided to erase the hints of Nick's gayness and I feel violated.   Not forgetting the feeling of excitement and mystery language when Nick met his wealthy neighbor Gatsby for the first time. He fell in love in first sight.    He smiled understandingly — much more than understandingly. It was one  of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that  you might come across four or five times in your life. It faced — or  seemed to face — the whole external world for an instant, and then  concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It  understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in  you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it  had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to  convey.     Nick wandered with vapid wonder in his smile. Nick loves Gatsby. He's obsessed with him: his hopes, his personality, his wealth, his life, his parties, his education, his aspiration, his true love for Daisy. He becomes so entangled in Gatsby's story because he is just too in love to have a life of his own.  Nick wanted us to believe, as he does, that Gatsby is different, that     only… the man who gives his name to his book, was exempt from [his]  reaction   of scorn because of Jay's     extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such that I have  never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall  ever find again.   In other words, he just said “I loved this man.”  I feel cheated, because one important thing is how Nick's sexuality affects what we are reading. If Nick is in love with Gatsby—and this seems pretty clear—then the entire novel operates as a rationalization of that misplaced love (unlike what is pictured in the movie). Probably, Nick romanticized Gatsby in the exact same way that Gatsby romanticized Daisy.   So why did this director Baz Luhrmann hide that? The film, in robbing him of his homosexuality (or bisexuality), also robs him of his reserve, and not coincidentally, of his intelligence. Expecting a more intelligent answer than in 2013, gay content is controversial, and gay characters can be hard for a lot of people to accept.. We're not in the 19th century anymore and there is no gay content anyway, just some signs of the gayness from the book. In the book he wasn't a gay character, there was some signs, why were they masked?",

And re-telling a book story in movie form, when you've got to get all the key details on screen in just 2 or 3 hours, means you have to omit many minor details. The core story of The Great Gatsby is about Gatsby and the world he lived in, not about Nick or Nick's potential attraction to Gatsby. In book form, there is plenty of room for the subplot suggestion that Nick is gay -- and the author Fitzgerald introduced the suggestion so subtly that most readers miss it. In the movie, however, throwing \"Nick might be gay\" at viewers along with everything else, in just 2 or 3 hours, could overwhelm them and/or distract from the core story -- and I'm not sure how it could be done as subtly on-screen as Fitzgerald pulled it off in the prose.

Sean notices that the caller refers to the victim as a she, although he couldn't know that the victim is a girl since he saw only the car and the body was dumped in the park. This tells Sean that the caller probably knew more about the case - but how did they make the connection to Silent Ray and his friend Johnny?

          "context": "This break through might look a little vague but still there was a shot in the dark for Sean and Whitey. The only connection they could make from the case was that the shot fired to kill Katie was fired using the gun of 'Just Ray'. So there was a possibility that someone from the Harris household would have committed the crime. However the elder Harris had passed his polygraph with flying colors as mentioned by Sean. When they went to question Katie's boyfriend Brendan for the first time at his house they had met the Harris junior with his friend John O'shea too. After listening to the 911 tape they found out that the boys knew more about the murder. Hence they might have taken a wild guess that mute Harris junior might have access to that gun and he was always with his friend John. Although it looks to be exaggerated but for investigative purpose they went to meet him. One more feasible explanation can be that after listening to the tape Sean and Whitey had gone to question Brendan about those two boys whom Katie might have known or have grudge against. But at the time they entered John had already drawn a gun over Brendan. Once police got them they confessed everything. CANNOTANSWER",

(I am much more worried about the Apollo mission technology used for a journey of at least a year. Could three astronauts just sit in the command module most of the time? I guess even the strongest personalities would have gone mad. There might have been a strong extended/additional stage of a modified Saturn rocket for the outward and return journey.

      "background": "As anyone who has seen the movie will tell you, the Eraserhead baby is the stuff of nightmares.     The baby itself is famous for being somewhat of a mystery. David lynch refuses to discus the baby, what it is, how it was created, or why it's so gosh darn creepy. The few comments he has made have been cryptic. Statements such as \"it was born nearby\" or \"maybe it was found\" have lead to rampant speculation including theories that it could possibly be such things as a skinned rabbit or a cow, lamb, or even human fetus.  The prop itself, nicknamed \"Spike\", featured several working parts making its eyes, mouth, and ears capable of independent operation.  What is the baby actually made of and what evidence do we have to prove this?",
      "paragraphs": [
        {
          "context": "The answer to that question is; no one will ever know. David Lynch knew he was onto something ethereal, so he prohibited any promotional photos of the baby and forced his SE crew to sign a release saying they could never talk about it. Lynch, himself, has always been elusive at best. All anyone will ever have is speculation, until Lynch decides to spill the beans. I want to add that the idea that the baby was living tissue has 2 main roadblocks; decomposition and Rigor Mortis. It is highly unlikely the baby was actually living tissue, though it may have been modeled on such. I have seen mention that it somewhat resembles a sheep fetus, so that may have been the vision Lynch worked from. Lynch would have needed several such fetuses for multiple days of filming, which just doesn't seem plausable. CANNOTANSWER",

This leads to a second possibility that she simply remembered him from the flight to Germany and it was just some small talk.

Dan Harmon has stated before that they don't really plan out the future details well in advance. They leave multiple different options open until the time comes to use a plot point. Then it becomes cannon. They want us to question if Beth is real or a clone going forward. That said, if Beth is a clone, I don't think we will find out for sure until there is a good reason to reveal that information. They now have another back-pocket dues ex machina where \"real\" Beth can always come out of nowhere and change any situation. Rick also makes it pretty clear that the audience wont really be able to tell either. He says \"Either way, you chill the f** out\" (or something like that); meaning we can't definitively say Beth's new behaviour is from cloning or just a new outlook. The ambiguity is essentially confirmed to be on purpose around 1:30 in this video from the writers/creators: (it's an adultswim link, might be region locked, I'm not sure, let me know if if it is). Also in Season 3 episode 10 Beth has to question this for herself, and it leads to the secondary plot in the episode. CANNOTANSWER",

She says she hates the color, hates how it smells like birds, and how its a \"guys apartment\".   HOWEVER... When she later moves in with Joey due to Monica and Chandler getting together, the apartment is in even worse condition than it was when she was previously living there with the well known neat freak Monica.  It just didn't make too much sense to me, and I know that this is just a nitpick, and it could just be an oversight of the writers and crew, due to how many episodes were made.",

Think about it for a second, if someone told you to get up and move into another apartment, especially one that seems smaller than Monica's would you do it? Her bed room is probably customized the way she likes it, if she were to move, she would have to spend time re-customizing it. Chandler Moves In Remember again, Rachel didn't think she would have to move out, she thought Chandler would move in, and it would be the three of them. However, the circumstances are different, after Las Vegas, Monica and Chandler agree to move in together. She attempts to move in with Ross, but they are still married unknowing to Rachel until the lawyer calls, at which point she furious. She eventually moves in with Phoebe, but the apartment burns down. This leaves Joey which means, Naked Thursdays or Wednesdays ;D. Out of necessity she moves in with Joey. She still lives close to her friends, and she doesn't need to get to know a new roommate. CANNOTANSWER",

All of what you see when you see a finished movie in a theater is the result of editing. In his Masterclass, David Mamet repeated a maxim regarding movies: \"You make a movie three times. Once when you write it, once when you film it, and once when you edit it.\" To actually answer the question, the frames that were spliced in were filmed at some point, and likely many frames or even feet were filmed. Then, during editing, a few frames were selected for each splice and edited into the desired spot in the film. In terms of how he filmed it, they just picked a set and had Brad Pitt in costume and makeup and filmed some footage. They also could have easily spliced in footage filmed for totally different scenes. When Fight Club was made, digital film editing using tools such as Avid was quite popular, and Fight Club was almost certainly edited digitally. This makes adding frames much easier than editing by cutting film. But splicing frames by actually cutting film isn't super difficult.

I recall seeing a documentary that showed Gary Oldman looking through a book of photos of his family (he had just split from Uma Thurman) on the set of Dracula that got him to the point of sorrow that Coppola wanted. I have worked with some amazing amateur actors that would work themselves up into a state before filming. One actress imagined something terrible happening to her sister, and she delivered a very powerful performance (that got the crew all choked up). If all else fails, the vapors from an onion can induce tears (but also cause redness), or a few drops of glycerin in the corners of the eyes can be released - but nothing beats real tears. I have also heard of directors bullying/belittling actors to the point of melt-down, just to get the shot they want. But that's a pretty extreme way to go about it. CANNOTANSWER",

When Forrest first finds out about being a father, he asks if he can be with Little Forrest. He goes over to him, sits down, and they both start watching TV. From that point on their actions are identical: They get caught up in the show at the same time, AND they tilt their heads slightly to the left at the same time. Later on, we see that they both love the same things naturally. Little Forrest loves to fish. Once again they get caught up in the sitting \"action\" of fishing with their heads tilted slightly to the left. Please observe this YouTube clip that shows the father and son tilting their heads to the left. Forrest, the father, goes to his son at around 4:20 minutes; they tilt their heads at around 4:38 minutes. In this YouTube clip, we see at 1:11 minutes that Little Forrest has a knack for ping pong.

Rosie spent too much time with him and it is also true that she could get her revenge without helping him. But she wanted not only to kill them but also to show the world what they did to her and why did such accidents occur and they deserved death sentence. At last everybody including Surjan came to know what they did. This is what she wanted. Another point also to be considered that like Frenny told \"Dissatisfied souls seek other dissatisfied souls(whether living or dead)\". Surjan was in pain, so maybe she thought of helping him as he was in pain due to his sons sudden death. After all till the end of the movie it is evident Surjan started believing in ghosts.

      "background": "In one of the final episodes of the Friends TV series, there is a scene where Monica and Chandler take Joey to visit the new house they are buying. There is a conversation between them like this:    Monica: Now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?    Joey: What? I get my own room?    Chandler: You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room  do you?   It's like that they will be living in the same house. But there's another scene when Monica breaks down the foosball machine to rescue the chicken, Chandler asks Joey if he would buy a new one, and he says no, because there is no point in it when there's no one to play with.  So, were they going to live in the same house or not?",

At his own surprised reaction you can already see that there was never a plan to have Joey living with them in their house. That would be a stetch even for Joey's and Chandler's relationship to have him living with Chandler and Monica in their house. Rather than that, the room is likely intended as a guest room dedicated specifically for Joey whenever he visits them and stays at their house. Either that or a kind of \"hobby room\" for Chandler and Joey to hang out in whenever he visits. The comment is rather tongue-in-cheek to begin with, so it's likely not a room only for Joey. It's a reminiscence to the good times Joey and Chandler had and a reassurance for him that those times, while maybe getting fewer, won't stop just because he got his own house to live in with Monica, a reminder that there will always be someone to play foosball with.

      "background": "In Game of Thrones Season 5, we see that the wildlings killed by Wights revive as Wights themselves. Jon Snow, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, gets hurt while battling the wights and one of the White Walkers. Later, he gets stabbed by his brothers in the Watch.   As he got hurt by the Wights and the Walker, does that mean he would revive as a Wight himself? Or is it such that those who get killed at the hands of a Wight only will revive as a Wight?",

Beyond that, I don't think we know all of the details about how that process works, what's required, etc. The only time, as far as I can remember, that we've seen it at work is the huge battle near the end of Season 5, where the Night King personally raised an army of dead wildlings as wights. It's also pretty clear that the characters in-universe don't understand it either. The Night's Watch is hyper-aware of the possibility of their dead coming back to life. They have burned the corpses of dead Night's Watchmen before. In fact, I believe in the Saason 6 trailer we've seen them trying to burn Jon's body as well, despite there being little chance of a Walker getting near it. CANNOTANSWER",

However, there doesn't seem to be much of a forethought given to what trailers are shown, besides making sure big movie trailers are shown before other big movies. For instance, the idea of seeing a Dark Knight Rises trailer before Avengers (two different production companies, let alone two rival comic book companies) doesn't seem to make much sense to me.  Is there a strict guideline trailers are released controlled by the MPAA or do the theatres have free run of what to show?",

The movie theater then tapes together these reels into usually 1 or 2 big reels(depending on what's capable of the projector and the size of the movie). During this time, they add on small preview reels. From what I can tell, usually 2 or 3 previews are shipped with a particular movie. It's not mandatory that theaters put them on, but they are usually the latest, so it gives theaters a good incentive. Unlike movie reels which must be returned, preview reels can be kept by the movie theater. So the movie theater can of course add on more previews if they wish as well. I believe it's allowed for them to add no previews on as well. Of course, with digital there is much less choice. I believe the previews with digital movies are completely fixed..

      "background": "In the eighth episode of the second season of Narcos when Murphy and Pena are interrogating Blackie the following dialogue can be heard:    Pena: Blackie Blackie, Blackie, Blackie. [Sighs] What name did your  mother give you?     Blackie: Nelson Hernandez... Lucumi­.    Pena: Lucumi­? From the Pacific. Lucumi, they found explosive residue  on your hands. On your jacket, everywhere. They're going to blame you  for that bomb, Lucumi­.   What made me curious about this is that both Murphy and Pena are initially surprised when hearing this unusual, African-sounding name, but then Pena quickly associates it with the Pacific.  I've done a quick research and found Lucumí people, but they live in Cuba, so have no association with the Pacific ocean.  Then I found this explanation from the book Afro-Latino Voices: Translations of Early Modern Ibero-Atlantic Narratives: lucumi was a term used by transatlantic slave traders to identify slaves that the Yoruba tribe was selling to them and was used as a self-identification term by the descendants of these slaves, that lived in Western South America and called themselves de casta lucumi (\"of the Lucumi caste\").  This one definitely seems related, but if Lucumi is not a family name, but a name of the people (or \"caste\") then why Blackie gave it as a name that his mother gave him and Pena was referring to him using it?  Could someone having knowledge on Colombian/South American culture explain that?  Edit: The information about lucumi being a name of the slaves of Yoruba origin can also be found in Spanish language Wikipedia (provided that the Google translation got it right). However both sources refer to a term used in 18th century, I didn't found any information regarding its current use, apart from being an actual family name.",

      "background": "In Game Of Thrones Season 4, the wildling Craster leaves his sons, from his wives (at the same time his daughters), into the woods to be taken by the White Walkers' king, after that he turned them into new White Walkers. I tried to figure out the reason behind this event, but no clues.  So, What is the story behind this action? And why does the White Walkers' king need those new born babies?",

So new daughters simply mean more workers and more \"company\", while a son is not really of use to him. And it is clear that Craster isn't really a man to shed tears for his dying kin. Rather on the contrary, a son could actually be a danger to him if he grows up and decides to revolt against his father's cruelty to his sisters. Craster has conditioned his daughters into obedience to him (and even more so in a medieval world where women were even less likely to revolt against their patriarch, even if they actually would have been able to do so in unison). A son might be harder to keep \"under control\" and as said, wouldn't have any use for Craster, since he doesn't really need a fighter, due to his arrangement with the Crows. It would merely mean a disruptance to the nice little life he's built himself there. So I think even without the White Walkers a son probably wouldn't have a long life at Craster's Keep.

I could get it if it were only actor accents (Daniel Huttlestone is British), and not character accents. But Thénardier's french accent is definitely a character one.

His accent is thick cockney, which is analogous to being common and uneducated in British culture. In disparity to this: Jean Valjean (whilst imitating someone of nobler birth) has correct enunciation and a statesmanlike presence. This is indicative of education, and a higher class citizen.

      "background": "I'm a bit confused about a scene in How To Train Your Dragon. When the Vikings reach the nest, they open holes and the dragons are flying away. Why didn't they do that in the first place and wait for the humans?  I mean, they had input/output ability from the nest (they could fly to the village to steal some food). Could it be that the queen kept some dragons as \"prisoners\" and only a subset of the dragons were going to the village, so that they are doomed to get back in the nest, so that they didn't lose their friends (just a thought, not a clue of this in the movie)?  I was wondering if someone could explain this to me or if it really is a plot hole in the story.",

          "context": "I don't have official source or script to draw from. However, my read on that scene is that they were waiting for the humans. The whole nest seems to be in a sort of button-up-and-fortify mode. The most the Vikings sniff of a dragon is the tail that gets whisked out of sight. This is more than likely intentional - note that the eerie sound that continues while the Vikings land and fortify continues right up until they punch the hole. It's a very similar sound to the sound the other Alpha dragons make in the second movie, while exerting dominance or control. The Alpha is holding it's nest on tight guard, possibly to pounce once it feels right. That all seems to go out the window when Stoick signals a fireball launched in. Whether that was just an agressive surprise, or read as some kind of direct challenge, I couldn't say for sure. The dragons in the tunnel though, didn't move until that moment, and it mostly seems to be an action of I'm-getting-the-heck-out-of-the-way as that Alpha decides to muscle out and deal with this personally.

He doesn't appear in Infinity War until the post-credits scene, and IIRC, there's no indication he knew about Thanos or his plan to wipe out half the universe.

Equally by obscuring the guards faces with a crude and claustrophobic cage they are somewhat dehumanised and more like automata than medical staff. Indeed the whole visual style of the film uses a lot of elements which evoke stylized dreamlike of hallucinogenic states which confuse individual sense of identity and many of the characters are driven by some sort of obsession and it is implied that Dr Seward is as much a prisoner of his work as the peopel he treats (or at least studies).

But as soon as Gus gets behind this he intervenes and apparently only by Walt's pleading lets Jesse live. He tries to arrange peace between Jesse and the dealers to avoid any further trouble. And as a compromise he tells the dealers    No more kids.   when Jesse tells him about Tomas (though, it's hard to imagine Gus didn't know about the usage of kids as subordinates, let alone care about it at all). And so far so good the peace seems settled.  But then suddenly Tomas ends up killed and I can't wrap my head around why (other than to further the story by making things escalate). Sure, for the dealers it might be an easy way to dispose of him, now that they're told \"no more kids\", but I don't think they would hazard such an action without permission from Gus. And I can't see what Gus really gained from Tomas' death. Even as an act of defiance to show Jesse who's the boss it doesn't make so much sense, seeing that he was quite interested in the \"peace treaty\" to avoid further trouble and he knew Jesse's temper and that this was bound to cause trouble once Jesse learns about it. If he really wanted the situation to escalate and get rid of Walt and Jesse, he could have offed them a lot easier and more unexpectedly. Or did he just hope for Walt to ditch Jesse once he goes postal, underestimating their bond? Did I miss anything relevant that may help to understand who ultimately made the plan to kill Tomas and why?",

For example, on Amazon streaming, the pilot episode \"On Leather Wings\" had the opening featuring Superman, while the next episode, \"Christmas with the Joker\", had the one I expected. There were a few others with the opening featuring Superman as well, it seemed somewhat random.

Vader has her in captivity, even tortures her and doesn't seem to sense her latent abilities. Luke, despite very brief training on the flight to Alderaan, is quickly identified by Vader as being strong, even when he is just another pilot in the battle over the Death Star.

The Titans themselves seem to be all the same, no distinction between any of them. After all, where is Chronus, Atlus, Gaia, etc? That being said, the reason that the 'immortal' Gods are so easily killed is because of that even matching of the Titans strength + numbers against the Gods. CANNOTANSWER",

Someone throws a rock through the window and Lamar (the man in the backwards ball cap) taunts one of the bikers, \"you sorry yet motherfucker? I told your cracker ass, bitch ass...\" and before he finishes he's pistol whipped and shot.   Rust immediately realizes the situation is heading south a lot faster than he had anticipated. Another biker smashes another window with his shotgun and begins to fire on the other gang members assembled outside. Rust somehow senses a shot is coming and ducks into the corner right before a bullet comes through the wall.   My question is, how did he know the shot was coming right there? Is there someone aiming a gun out of focus that we can't see or was he just playing it safe and ended up being right?",

Once the armed group outside is being fired upon by the shotgun, Rust expects return fire. This explains why he exits the living room. Rust is also trying to secure the Iron Crusaders member, Ginger (Joseph Sikora). This explains why he moves towards him. That a bullet just happens to go through the wall in between the two and the camera is likely just a conveniently plausible location for the effect to happen. Given the position of the two relative to the broken window being fired through, it is very conceivable that a bullet could just as easily hit either of them. That said, we can not actually see anyone through the window at any time. At most, we see shadows prior to the rock throw. We do not see any of the people who are returning fire. Rust sees that the situation is becoming unmanageable and makes his play to secure a way out, grab Ginger and leave.

The question is How/Why did Tyler got shot in the head when the narrator himself shot in the mouth? It could have been somewhere else and not the head, right?   Is this just because the Narrator \"really\" wanted Tyler to listen to him and die?   Since Tyler is just a hallucination, we know that Tyler dies when narrator mind accepts his death. The narrator can't do this on his own, since he needs Tyler's permission to do so (otherwise why would he ask Tyler to listen to him?). Now, if he really wanted Tyler to die, he could have shot Tyler directly and imagined his death, which would have lead to the end of Tyler.  Is this shooting scene in the significance of \"Fight Club\" where the narrator wanted to shoot himself just with the spirit of hurting himself? Does this indicate that Narrator and Tyler became one at the end?   Was that shot really needed to kill Tyler? What would have happened if Tyler also got shot in his mouth and was alive instead of getting shot in his head?  I have attempted the plot-explanation, but I watched the movie only once long back... I would be glad if someone can expand this/ explain this even better.",

While before beating him up would have worked, it was just a physical representation of a mental battle. By bringing in an actual object into the fray, his attempts at Tyler's life are pointless. We see the Narrator finally realize that he has been in control all along and this is why he is presented able to take the gun from Tyler, because he is the one actually holding the gun. It is then he realizes that he must follow Tyler's own advice and \"hit bottom\". Only by doing so, is he able to control his own body and \"kill\" Tyler. To hit bottom he realizes he must do something life-threatening and plain insane. Whereas the bullet only blew a hole in his cheek, it was his mental F--- You to Tyler, showing him that he can take care of himself now, which is why the bullet is shown to have gone through the back of Tyler's head, killing him.

      "background": "The “Wilhelm Scream” is a stock sound-effect that has been used in hundreds of films over the years as an inside-joke/homage among filmmakers. It was first heard in the 1951 film Distant Drums but is famously named after Private Wilhelm who is shot with an arrow and screams in the 1953 film The Charge at Feather River.  The scream rose to fame in recent decades when Star Wars sound designer Ben Burtt used it in his work on Star Wars and other films. And other filmmakers have followed the lead—such as Quentin Tarantino, Tim Burton, and Peter Jackson—and used it themselves in their films.  If you are unaware of what the Wilhelm Scream sounds like, watch this video compilation which includes clips of it's use in Star Wars films among others:       Since each Star Wars film including the prequels has had at least one occurrence of the “Wilhelm Scream” in them, can anyone recall/remember if the Wilhelm Scream was heard anywhere in The Force Awakens? I realize the film is still in theaters and sources for actual clips don't exist at this point, but some description of a scene and perhaps who might have screamed the Wilhelm Scream would be appreciated.",

Beyond throwing CGI money away on such an inconsequential shot, if you look at the other man's features you'll notice much different bone and cartilage structures around the eye sockets, more-centered zygomatic bones (cheekbones), and a more acute angle where the nasal bones indent and leave the brow. Plus, this man looks nothing like The Professor / Bernard Fallon (Borden's alter-ego). I see no reason to assume this is anything other than someone reading too much into a slight resemblance. Do I have definitive proof? No, I do not. Also, I have difficulty in seeing any kind of compelling resemblance between the two men. Another thing to consider is that the twins kept public contact at a minimum. They did not seem to \"hang out\" together. This is explained by Borden's reveal of the so-called \"frail\" old Chinese magician whose act was basically performed off-stage; ie: the man was fit enough to work heavy bowls of water but presented himself as a feeble old man who required canes and / or assistance to go to and from the theater. That was the real act. Borden would not likely risk exposure by sitting next to himself. CANNOTANSWER",

I know a little about the books and character, and was surprised by the inclusion of a scene like this (plus other comedic asides).   Is this tone true to the book series, or did Christopher McQuarrie deliberately change things up through his script and direction?",

The plot is simpler with fewer characters. The overall tone is not too far from the books, but the opportunity for cinematic additions has been taken. The slapstick scene is pure cinema invention (I'm not even sure you can do slapstick like that in prose writing). Some of the humorous dialogue, though, is true to Reacher's character in the book. I recall some inventive insults in the bar scene, for example, which are the sort of things he does say in the books as a result of his unshakeable confidence in dealing with people he has to fight. He really doesn't mind getting physical as he know he will win, so insulting his adversaries and goading them is a typical strategy. Overall the movie captures the spirit of the books reasonably well, but the slapstick scene sticks out as an anomaly. CANNOTANSWER",

The Marquis de Sade. Works of Saint Thomas Aquinas.  There. He wrote about the seven deadly sins.   These are the books that John Doe had checked out. John Doe was shown to be extremely knowledgeable in the Seven Deadly sins. He obviously had been studying them for quite some time to the point of obsession.  Also, we see that John Doe's apartment is stocked with several books.    I understand that the notebooks to the left of Somerset are John Doe's personal writings. However, there are several books shown in his apartment.  The police officer even states how well educated and wealthy he is.

Finally, despite those books in his apartment, IIRC we are never told what those books are about. They might have had nothing to do with the seven deadly sins (John Doe wanted to avoid having incriminating evidence on his home, perhaps?), and thus all of his knowledge came from renting the books in the library. The books in his house might have been educational on a ton of other subjects or philosophies. Also keep in mind, the Internet still wasn't a thing back then. And books such as the ones mentioned (on bondage, homicide, or by Italian Dominican friars) might have not been easily found in your regular old book store.

It's not restricted to blood; it could be water, if it's a particularly stormy scene, or mud in, say, a battle. Any kind of liquid, really. The point is that the scene is usually pretty charged.  Has this become fashionable and, if so, why? I don't recall seeing this as much when I was younger -- but maybe I just didn't notice -- and, for me, it breaks the suspension of disbelief. I presume the production team are in control of the filming enough such that they can choose if or when this happens, rather than it being accidental. Is it a meta thing to try to suggest to the viewer that the scene is so chaotic, that even the producers can't control it?",

      "background": "Yesterday I watched The Huntsman: Winter's War (2016).   In this movie there is one particular scene in which the snow queen asked Sara to kill Eric. So Sara shot an arrow that hit Eric; he fainted and looked like he is dead and then Sara and the snow queen left with the army of the snow queen leaving 2 dwarfs and Eric's body.  The dwarfs pull the arrow from Eric's body with difficulty and they do Eric woke up and the dwarfs are stunned by that. Eric looks to his locket suggesting that the locket took most of the force of the hit.  I have several questions about this particular scene.   How can Eric survive such an attack? You can see Eric dodge backwards by the impact of the arrow in that scene and immediately faint on the ground. Even if Sara hit the locket intentionally to take most of force of the arrow, how can she manage to hit it in a way that the arrow hit the locket without breaking it into two (or several parts) and also it hit Eric's chest? And in such a way that doesn't kill him. (You can say that arrow hit Eric also as it is still intact to body and the dwarfs use quite a strength to remove it from the body and there is also blood on his chest). Did Sara hit some special spot of his body that makes Eric faint and removing it wakes him up? And in the immediate next scene he looks normal with blood on his chest, smiling and planning with the dwarfs about how to enter the castle like nothing has happened.   Sara never misses but how is she able to execute such a hard task?   Is there something that I am missing or am I thinking too much and should just watch and enjoy?",

      "background": "Criminal Minds S9 Ep2 - \"The Inspired (Part II)\"  When they make arrests at the end:    There seems to be some difficulty over whether they have Jesse or Wallace. They use his learned nervous tick as a differentiator and arrest him accordingly.   Why would they need to do this?     Surely they could just ask him questions that Jesse would know the answer to (e.g. who are these pictures of? What happens in a normal day at work?) and demonstrate it was Wallace by his lack of knowledge of Jesse's life? Also, the BAU would knew he suffered from hallucinations, if they kept him talking long enough he would eventually give himself away.   Perhaps there is there some aspect of the American legal system that I am not familiar with? Or did miss something in the episode?",

When I originally saw the movie, I thought the quick cut was meant to show that it was the next day, and that Bond had spent the entire night at the bar. However, I have seen some speculate that the first scene was merely a daydream - Bond imagining how he would like his life to be, when in reality he spends his time drinking alone in the middle of the day.

I happened to watch it last week on FX a couple of times in a row, and I was thinking after the movie that it never really showed us about their eating habits and how they survive during the zombie apocalypse. We know Harrelson's character was obsessed with Twinkies, but he didn't find one until the end, and there was this truck with snowballs in the movie. There was no reference further in the movie if they were surviving on that.  What do all the main characters eat during the course of the movie?   Judging from the timeline in the movie I wonder if all the grocery stores in towns stopped carrying fresh food after the mutation struck? Anyone have any interesting answers to my question?",

Later the detective explains how the police got their location:    The detective questioning Shadow is intrigued by the tip she got on the two criminals: A fax, complete with GPS coordinates, provided using the same technology that helped catch Osama bin Laden. ” You two have very extravagant enemies,” she notes.   Mr.World had to kill everyone in the police station to meet Shadow and Wednesday.    Mr. World's violence continues on the way out; when Shadow and Mr. Wednesday finally emerge, they realize that everyone in the precinct is dead.   Why did Mr.World involve the police and gave them the coordinates? If they needed to talk to Shadow and Wednesday, why didn't they just go to the motel room since they had the coordinates?",

However, in the room Wednesday and Shadow were kept, Media, World, and Technical Boy were able to enter unobstructed, through the only exit, so it was very much their ground. Secondly, it was a show of power. Wednesday is on the wrong side of the law (after the robbery), but the new gods aren't - or at least, they're useful to the law, with the satellites and all the like. They wanted to show Wednesday that they had the capability to track him if the wanted, and that he had something, namely the whole of law enforcement, to be aware of. Thirdly, I think it's the matter of not getting their hands dirty. Gods, both in the novel and in the series so far, operate through proxies - Wednesday has Shadow, Technical Boy had those dumb henchmen. It's possible (though unlikely) that the New Gods don't want to be on the wrong side of law enforcement as well, and the law enforcement was looking for the bank robber anyway. In this case Mr. World simply used the policy in place of his own men, but disposed of them as they became unnecessary (which could be seen as yet another show of power). CANNOTANSWER",

Logan gets upset and goes to nicely ask the guys to move. They give him grief, but before he rocks their world, Kayla intervenes, calming the truck driver. The driver then turns around and leaves; there is no incident.   What is the purpose of this scene? Is it to show that Kayla has some kind of power? From what I've read, she doesn't have any powers that allow her to manipulate other people. When Logan and Kayla get back into the car, they have an exchange about it where Kayla denies having power because Logan still got out of the car.  So what was the point of this scene?",

      "background": "In Breaking Bad, Mike clearly calls Jimmy by his alternate name \"Saul\" multiple times. In Better Call Saul, we see that their paths are crossed quite considerably before Jimmy even starts using his alter ego of Saul Goodman.  Why does Mike entertain this alter ego name? He doesn't seem to be the type of guy who would do so, regardless of Jimmy's reasons for using it. It seems to be a bit of a plot hole (granted, it isn't a big one). I can see why someone would disagree with me on this point, but Gilligan's style is so careful and thought-out that it's surprising that something like this would be left unturned. Concepts of Better Call Saul were thought of well before Breaking Bad had finished airing, so I would've thought they had plenty of time to close any of these holes.",

Mike is exactly the sort of person who would hear \"I've changed my name to Saul\" and shrug it off with a casual \"Whatever,\" and then proceed to call him only Saul from then on. Mike is the kind of guy who does the job he's asked to do and doesn't ask any questions that he doesn't need the answers to. As long as you play it straight, he will too. Refusing to call Jimmy \"Saul\" would potentially disrupt any shady dealings they were involved in together, if third parties only knew the name Saul. It would also be an indiscretion to casually blow Saul's cover by calling him Jimmy just because Mike knows his real name. Of all the characters seen in either show, Mike is the most discreet and conscientious of the sensitive nature of the illegal operations these people so often find themselves embroiled in. Unless he had a good reason NOT to call Jimmy \"Saul,\" I believe he would do so without batting an eyelash. CANNOTANSWER",

It's clear that he doesn't recognise the danger. He ignores Coop's verbal warning as well as the master alarm, something a real astronaut would never ever do.

Now, I haven't read either of those books, but I do know what The Art of War is about and so I understand what the \"obvious reasons\" are for it being popular in prison.  I looked up the plot to The Other Side of Midnight on Wikipedia, and it seems to be mostly about a French woman trying to get what she wants (namely a relationship with an American pilot) through seduction and manipulation. The most relevant thing to prison or the justice system seems to be that at the end, the woman and the pilot plead guilty to murder because they think a plea bargain is in place, when in fact there is no bargain.  Later in the episode    someone leaves a copy of The Other Side of Midnight on Naz's bed, with a note that says \"take the deal.\"   How does that make sense, since seemingly    the lesson of TOSoM is to not make a plea deal because you can't trust that there actually is a deal, so why couple the book with the advice to take the deal?
