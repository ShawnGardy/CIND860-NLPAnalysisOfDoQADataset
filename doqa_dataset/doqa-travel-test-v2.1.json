So if you plan to visit some shop on the 2nd of January, you may want to call them in advance in order to verify that they will open on that day.g CANNOTANSWER",

Worst case scenario (if he wasn't already arrested for a grievous violation such as a DUI), is he'll be asked to appear in court later, if the police report says he is at-fault, and he is charged with a violation. He can probably waive his right to a court hearing, by mail (depending on what he is charged with), and pay whatever the default penalties are. If he is not at-fault, then he probably doesn't need to do anything in New Jersey, from a legal standpoint. His insurance company will likely want to inspect the vehicle. If it's undrivable, that means in NJ, but he probably doesn't need to be around for that. The only reason I can think of he may need to stick around (or return) to NJ if he is not at-fault is if the state wants him as a witness in prosecuting the other driver(s).

I've tried asking the wait staff if I can leave a tip by card but they either misunderstood me or their POS terminal didn't have such a feature. \n",

In Canada for example over the last several years when we moved to chip credit-cards, the machines prompt for an optional tip. Many even give the option of calculating it for you by entering a percentage. With swipe cards which are still common in the US, the bill includes an extra line where you can set a tip and sum it. You then sign and they complete it as a single transaction which includes the tip. In some places, you are right though that you may need to carry cash in small denominations for tips. Although this seems to be uncommon in places where tips are a larger portion of income. In countries where I had to transact by credit cards and then add a cash tip, it is usually a small amount, more like rounding the total than adding 10-15%. CANNOTANSWER",

The seat space depends on how you measure it - a 17.5\" seat cushion or between the arm rests may still leave you with less space overall because airlines have started shrinking arm rests and aisles in order to start fitting 9-abreast, 10-abreast and, god forbid, 11-abreast seating into their aircraft. The outcome of this is that you may still get 17.5\" of width in which to put your bum, but your shoulders and elbows have less room and thus the overall space feels more cramped. This is something you will only see in widebodied aircraft, because a 737s 6-abreast is currently the maximum an airline is legally allowed to use, resulting in a 3-3 configuration. On widebodied aircraft, the standards have risen from 2-2-2 to 2-4-2, 3-3-3 and we are starting to see 3-4-3 being offered, and the space for that increase comes generally from the aisles and seats themselves (although some airlines are finding a few inches from narrower fuselage linings).

Is that still the reason for primarily offering manuals?\n\nThe above question & answers indicate that Japan is now mostly (exclusively?) automatics in the rental market. I believe the same is true of NZ and Australia. Are those countries ahead of the curve, or are European countries behind it?\n\nEDIT: Of course, NZ and AU import a huge number of their cars from Japan, so that's probably trickled on through to the rental market (Japan produces less manual cars, countries can't import as many manuals, less available to buy, rental companies wind up with mostly automatics).\n",

Locals are most likely to look for manual transmissions since that is more prevalent. When renting to tourists the cost of ownership of the car, from the point of view of the rental agency, must be divided by the volume of tourists renting which is likely lower than that of locals. One place where this is taken yet a step further is Iceland where the cost of automatic car rentals is quite expensive. They have a very short tourist season, around 3 months, where they most cover their costs and accumulate profits. The large fleets of rental cars remains largely unused the remainder of the year. That is exactly what the explained to me when I commented about how much more costly it was to rent a car there. CANNOTANSWER",

This week, they informed me the BOS -> YHZ flight is canceled, and are wanting to route me BOS -> YYZ -> YHZ -> GLA, doubling the length of the itinerary.\n\nI've called WestJet and they say they can't come up with anything better, so I'm looking for other alternatives.  \n\nOne possibility is to book a flight on a separate airline from BOS -> YHZ, then take the original YHZ -> GLA flight (after telling WestJet that's what I'm doing, to avoid being seen as a no-show when I don't get on the plane in BOS; the agent I talked to said this would be possible).  \n\nThe concern is that I will be traveling with checked bags, and these would be two separate tickets, so I'm assuming I will need to clear customs in YHZ, collect my bags, and then re-check them and go through security again, and I don't know how long that will take.  Assuming nothing changes (and my faith in that is...tentative, at best), I will have 1 hour 50 minutes between the flights.\n\nQuestions:\n\nAre my assumptions correct?  I will need to collect bags, clear customs, re-check the bags, clear security?\nHow long does that process normally take? The flight from Boston is a small plane, arriving at 9 PM on a Sunday.\nHow long might that process take in the worst case scenario? (I mean, I suppose the worst case is it takes days because something goes horribly wrong, so I guess I'm really looking for an idea of what's a reasonable upper limit...)\nIt might be possible to get NEXUS before the trip.  How much will that affect things?\n\n",

If all goes well, you may have a chance to make it but it is very risky and if you miss it you carry the full responsibility and may have to buy a brand new ticket on the spot. And you probably have to spend the night in Halifax too. In addition to the steps you listed, you also have to pass immigration. Immigration, bag retrieval, customs are all notoriously unpredictable. I once had to beg my way through the long line at immigration in Ottawa. At 9pm they only had one booth open and it took forever. Since apparently I was the only one with a connection, the other passengers kindly passed me through. You also need to do a full check in with WestJet in Halifax and the minimum bag check in time is 60 minutes. That gives you only 50 minutes for deplaning, immigration, bag retrieval, customs and getting to check in. Not impossible but way too risky especially if you fully responsible for the consequences of missing it CANNOTANSWER",

Branded sports / outdoor clothing stores have sales of autumn clothes in autumn and spring, i.e., when they are about to bring in fresh stock and when demand drops off, respectively. Right now, by Indian standards, Delhi and a lot of Northern India is experiencing a 'cold wave' so demand must be high. If you're reaching around March, you'd probably find more sales. Go to the central Connaught Place shopping area in Delhi - most backpackers stay in Paharganj, which is close by - and check what apparel stores have sales, if any. If you find a good deal, take it! You're more likely to find deeper discounts in Delhi than in smaller Indian towns. The Palika Bazaar underground shopping complex in the same area may have better deals but those will usually be fake goods. There are other shopping centres in Delhi too but not any that will sell the kind of quality gear you want at cheap prices.

They are not always the fastest way of getting around (Google Maps sometimes claims buses are faster; I think long-distance buses might be delayed more often, though, and this isn't reflected in their information). However, they are very inexpensive, comfortable enough, have toilets onboard, require no reservation, and are usable with the EasyCard payment system. I personally prefer them to buses. I also avoided traveling on what seem to be the most intense travel days around New Years. However in general I rarely felt crowded in the Taipei area. CANNOTANSWER",

They may be able to check you in early or if not they will likely be able to hold your bags until the room is ready and you can wander around the area for a while (best way to get over jetlag, walking around in the daylight). The reason they told you they would charge you to reserve the room for early check in, because in order for you to have it at 8 am, they have to keep it empty the night before and therefore they lose the potential revenue for that room that night. And five star hotels are just as revenue conscious as a one star hotel. But if you just show up in the morning and if the room wasn't rented the night before, they maybe willing to check you in early. And fwiw, if you had flown business class, you still would not have access to the lounges in Suvarnabhumi, as upon landing you have to clear immigration and customs right away, you can not wait in the departure area where the lounges are.

Train tickets and bus tickets are not legal proof, but maybe accepted (then again may not be) by the agent. Thai Immigration rarely checks this aspect, but they do have the right to, and I have personally witnessed them asking people to prove such. So not having proof is a double crap shoot. Best bet is to buy an airline ticket to a neighboring country that leaves before your 30 days are up. Either a dirt cheap throw away airfare (Air Asia has a sale going on right now) or an expensive fully refundable airfare. Then you can leave your flight home as you originally planned. You can also apply for a tourist visa in advance, which would give you 60 days entry and possibility for a 30 day extension. While this still requires proof of exit, airlines tend to overlook the outbound rule when boarding (but not 100% guaranteed, as I had to talk my way on once with a Non-Imm visa for a longer stay). You have to weigh costs of the Visa vs cost for a cheap airfare. CANNOTANSWER",

I was specifically looking for this counter/service and was not able to find it. There was a single currency exchange counter, a souvenir shop and a hallway to connecting flights and that was it.\n\nIt seems to be a really small airport/terminal and also there is some construction going on - which might be the reason why I could not find it.\n\nThe webpage for the airport has been down for weeks and is of no use. \n\nTo give an overview of what I saw at the airport - first there were the usual passport check booths, right after the booths there was a single belt, from which we picked up our luggage. Then there was the customs check and finally we were in a relatively smallish hall with exit (to taxis) to the left and the currency exchange to the right of us. Maybe the international arrivals are just separated from everything else?\n\nDoes anyone know now for sure that this service really does exist as of December 2014?

I have never travelled internationally before and just picked the one with the shortest layover.\n\nAccording to step 5 here[1] I don't have to pass through customs, though I'd hardly say its a reliable resource.\n\nThis map seems to show UA exclusively limited to terminal 7/8 and apparently there is an \"airside\" inter-terminal connection between 6,7 and 8.\n\nSo I'm figuring that if UA99 lands at 7/8 and UA1077 departs from 7/8, then I can get off one plane, walk to the gate and get on the next, without any customs or immigration? I'm also carry-on only, so no bags to drop/collect/etc.\n\nIs it reasonable to think that?\n\nRelatedly, if I was to miss my connection due to immigration, delays, etc, would United rebook me to the next available since I booked \"one ticket\"?\n\n\nwikihow com Switch-Flights-in-LAX (sorry, can't post more than one link..., add a dot and a slash...)\n\n",

However their website was in Spanish/Catalan and the stations themselves didn't have a registration option, so I gave up. Reading up on Bicing later on I've found the following paragraph on Wiki:\n\n\n  The Bicing member cards are only sent to addresses in Catalonia in an attempt to prevent tourists from using the system.\n\n\nIs this still true as of 2016? If so, is it possible to register and send a Bicing card to a friend's/hotel's address?\n\nThe official website also mentions an \"In person\" (\"De manera presencial\") registration option.

      "background": "I travelled alone in Japan for business, for 10 days. I declared that I bought items for $550,  well under the $800 limit. After my non-stop flight from Japan landed at YYZ, I was directed to secondary inspection at approx. 5 PM. The female CBSA (Canada Border Services Agency) officer inspected all my belongings and the receipts for my purchases. \n\nAt 5:15, she started alleging that some other items (like clothing, 1 backup pair of eyeglasses, 1 pair of sunglasses) were bought in Japan, as they looked too new and clean to have been bought in Canada. Of course they did...I'm a business professional! But  they aren't that new in fact, and I bought them in Canada. \n\nI repeated that they were bought in Canada and were brought by me to Japan. She said that she didn't believe me. She  demanded proof that they were bought in Canada. I answered that I bought the clothing in Toronto and can't remember exactly where or when. I told her the name and approximate locations of some opticians that I remember. It feels unreasonable to expect weary travelers to remember details on the spot, without  records on hand.\n\nShe then got angry and rude. She said  that I was being evasive and warned me not to lie. She threatened to seize my items. She admonished that I, not she, had the onus of proving to her that I bought these items in Canada. \n\nAt 5:45, I requested politely to speak to her supervisor. She asked why. I answered that I was a little jaded from being reasked the same questions and repeating the same answers for 30 minutes. She got  more offended and ruder, when she raised her voice to ask why I thought she was wasting my time and asking irrelevant questions. I answered that I never said this at all. She said that I don't need a supervisor, if I had nothing to hide. \n\nAt 6, I reiterated my request for a supervisor, and she bitterly told me to be patient. At 6:20, a supervisor showed up, and we repeated the same questions before I was allowed to leave at 6:45. \n\nIn all, I spent 105 minutes in secondary inspection. My tone was always deferential and polite. \n\n\nWhat can be done in the future, to avoid this kind of wrangle, and waste of time? What could I have done better? \n\nI don't intend to complain against her...I'm too frightened of retaliation and being black-listed.  \nHas this wrangle has already put me on some list and blemished my CBSA records?\n\n",

      "background": "my main two questions are:\n\nCan I travel to Europe having a ticket from US to Mexico and then another one from Mexico back to US (with 2 weeks difference) but going to Europe in the middle of those 2 flights (specifically, to Amsterdam)? Like kind of a trip to Europe and back but with a one day layover each way. I wonder if I would be able to re-enter the US after this trip or if I would have some problems at customs.\n\nIf not, do I have other options for traveling to Europe and coming back while having my TN expired but my I-94 valid? I was thinking of using my B1/B2 visa to re-enter the us (if that's a possibility).\n\nI checked other travel stackexchange questions and none of them are asking for the specifics of traveling to Europe with an expired TN and whether the trip is fine as long as I depart to and return from Mexico.\n\nThe whole background for my specific situation is:\n\nI'm a Mexican citizen and I've been working in the US for a few years now (always legally), my latest TN visa expired more than a year ago and my current employer filled an I-797C form to extend my working period validity (the document is listed as a TN2 class request). After filling that form, I received an I-797A “approval notice” mentioning that the extension was approved and such document ha dan I-94 at the bottom valid until 2021.\n\nI have already presented my expired TN visa together with the TN2 approval notice (which has the newest I-94) to re-enter the US after several short term (less than 30 days) trips to Mexico but I never left Mexico in any of those trips. This time I want to do the same but traveling outside of Mexico in the middle of my stay, I want to do this trip, I even bought my flight tickets already but after reading different sources I don't know if I will be able to re-enter the US to continue working normally.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that, I'm planning on changing my employer in about 2 moths (after the trip) for which I would need to apply for a new TN visa with my new employer and it doesn't make sense for me to get another TN visa with my current employer (for being able to travel anywhere).\n\nI was reading this official government site and it explicitly says that nonimmigrant visa holders may be admitted at CBP if they meet certain requirements like “Nonimmigrants who departed the United States for brief travel to Canada, Mexico”. I would technically be doing a brief travel to Mexico but not sure if I'm ok by leaving Mexico in the middle of such brief travel.\n\nIn the other hand, I was also reading this other official government site which makes me think I will actually face problems when re-entering because of the part that says “ The person did not visit any countries other than Mexico or Canada in that period.”.\n\nSo I'm really confused whether I should do this trip or not (again, the total trip is only 2 weeks) because I need to be able to re-enter the US after that.\n\nIf I can't do this trip, I also believe there might be other ways of being able to travel that I'm not even aware of (other than requesting a new TN visa).\n\nAlso, I don't know if using my B1/B2 for re-entering is valid (or even recommended).\n\nSo I'm asking for people expertise in here to know a real answer on whether I can or cannot proceed with my travel plans (and any alternatives, if not).\n\nThanks in advance for taking the time to read.\n",

          "context": "You have basically answered your own question. When you have a short trip to Mexico and return to the US, as you've stated, you are re-entered under your existing I-94 \"status\" under the Automatic Revalidation process. One of the condition for Automatic Revalidation is that you have only traveled to Mexico or one of a few other close countries, but not to any other country - such as Amsterdam. If you were to visit Amsterdam and then try and re-enter the US it is certainly possible that the US immigration staff would not realize you left Mexico and entered Amsterdam, however if they were to look at your passport closely enough they could be able to confirm that due to the entry stamp for Amsterdam. If this was to occur you would almost certainly be refused entry into the US. You can NOT use a B1/B2 visa to re-enter the US. Doing so would invalidate your TN status and you would be entered into the US in B1/B2 status instead, which would leave you unable to work as the B1/B2 is not a work visa. CANNOTANSWER",

(Doha being a connecting flight and I would only stay there for an hour or 2. Going through security then my gate and waiting for my flight). And india being my destination. \n\nI checked India's entry requirements and it stated passport and sufficient visa which I do have. I have an oci card(indian life long visa) which allows me to come and go as I please. \n\nI checked Qatar's visa requirements and it said a visa is not needed if on transit if you have an onward ticket. Is this onward ticket a ticket from doha to india? Or is it a return flight? I will be staying with my family in india and i'm not sure if or when I want to come back so a return ticket wouldn't make sense in my situation. \n\nPlease someone advise me. If getting a return ticket is better and will avoid any hassle then please let me know. \n\nAlso does qatar airways not allow you to board the flight if you have a one way ticket and not return? As many people have said that many airlines don't allow you to board if you have a one way ticket. \n\nhttp://www.qatarairways.com/global/en/visa-and-passport-requirements.page#\n",

In your case, that would mean that they will check that you meet the requirements to enter India.

      "background": "I know this question was asked many times, and I read most of the answers, only my quest centers on the time that has passed since my overstay. \n\nBriefly, my story is I visited the US as a tourist from Argentina in 1993, and being there I wanted to try the experience to live there for a while, rented an appartment, could get a basic job as a driver doing deliveries, and ended up living for about one and a half years. After that, and realizing living as an illegal was a deadend with no promisory future, I just picked my things, bought a plane ticket and departed in 1994 never to return. \n\nLong story short, after almost 25 years, now I´m a professional, have a good situation and would just like to make a short vacation there. \n\nHere´s my main doubt; I´m not sure if it´s convenient or relevant to mention my overstay when applying for a visa, considering after such a long time they may not have record of that; or do Customs keep records for that long, and could backfire me here at the Consulate, or upon arrival at the airport? \n\nI add additional information \nTo make things more interesting, I also have an italian passport. Since I am of italian descent I own the double citizenship. This passport grants me VWP, but that doesn´t guarantee automatic entrance, that´s why I chose to go with the argentinian one which needs a visa. I assume that having a visa makes entrance more likely since you underwent a previous official scrutiny; or does it not? Besides using a different passport could seem an obvious way to dodge that scrutiny and make it even harder.\n",

Since the next German world cup game is pretty important we want to watch and support our team on Saturday (8 pm) against Sweden.\n\nUnfortunately I don't speak Portuguese so I could not find a place online where this match will be shown. Does anybody know a place where we could watch the match Sweden - Germany / Saturday 8 pm in Lisbon? It does not have to be fancy but if possible it should be quite central and/or close to where we stay (city district Baixa).\n\nI framed the question a bit broader because answers might be helpful for German visitors who will be visiting Lisbon at a later time during the world cup (and if Germany makes it to the Best of 16s of course).\n",

The ticket was issued on BA (125) stock, for the Malaysian flight with a MH flight number. BA have given me a 6 character Amadeus reference, and a 5 character Malaysian reference for the flight.\n\nIf I try to use the BA Manage My Booking, with the Amadeus reference, I get the error \"Sorry, we are unable to add bookings that do not contain any British Airways flights to your account.\". This error might make sense, were it not for the fact that it happily lets me manage BA ticketed flights with Cathay Pacific and Qantas. Clearly there is more OneWorld ticketing integration on the BA wesbite than the person writing the error message knows... But apparently integration with Malaysian isn't one of the supported one.\n\nNext up, I tried the Malaysian website, and tried to use their Manage My Booking with the 5 character reference I have. That gives the error \"We are unable to process your booking online. Please contact our call center\". \n\nFinally, I tried with the FinnAir website, as I know they are able to manage most OneWorld airline bookings, often even in cases when the ticketing or operating airline won't! FinnAir is able to show me the details of the flight, which is a good start, but sadly isn't able to let me select my seat.\n\nAm I falling down the cracks between not fully integrated OneWorld ticketing systems here? Or is there another trick to let me manage such a booking online? (I've never had much luck with phoning Malaysian Airlines in the past is all....)\n",

So far I believe the number that have apparently been damaged by airport scanner stands at about 2 for Kindle, and I've never heard of a smartphone being damaged by any form of scanners. (And in the case of the Kindles there's serious doubt it was caused by the X-ray machine, and not simply broken in the customer bags) In general the only items that should not be put through the standard X-ray machine are very high ISO film (800 or higher) and some very specialized medical devices (and if you had one of those, you'd already know about it). You are far more likely to cause damage to your phone by dropping it when trying to put it in the tray than you are having it broken by the equipment itself. There is no need to remove your Kindle from your carry-on bag, so just make sure it's packed well and you'll be fine. If you're carrying a laptop you WILL need to remove that from your bag (unless you have a special TSA-approved laptop bag) - again the only real risk is in dropping it or forgetting to collect it afterwards.

I have read a lot of conflicting information on the safety of night buses, and I have begun to alarm myself.\n\nIs lugging a rather large suit case across most of London at 1 in the morning going to be a safety concern (i.e. is it worth shelling out a rather large sum of money for a taxi?), or should I be fine?  \n\nIs there anything I should know or avoid doing?\n",

There might be partiers, revellers, half-comatose drunkards, couples, drunkards being ill, fights, arguments, tears - but never boredom. Saying that, I never once felt unsafe. I too travelled to various airports including Heathrow on night buses, with a big backpack. You could also take a taxi for around 80-90 quid (from memory) if you really felt unsafe, but do remember - there are (at least there used to be when I was there) seven cameras on every double decker bus. You're under constant surveillance, and personally I felt that helped. If in doubt, sit up close to the front near the driver, just to have someone you can trust nearby. It's also close to a door - not that you'll need to get out fast, but it's nice not to feel trapped which you might if you were down the back or upstairs. CANNOTANSWER",

Based on the anecdotal evidence available to us, this rule is not really enforced consistently. However, it does provide an impeccable ground for the border officer to deny you entry if he doesn't like the color of your shoes. And it is possible that the airline will refuse boarding you if you have neither a valid visa nor a round-trip ticket. If you do attempt this plan, you should expect that the border officer will notice the future visa in your passport, and be prepared to convince him that (a) you're not going to start work before you're allowed to, and (b) you will actually make the visa run later, because the rules do not allow you to change from VWP to H-1B status while in the US. At the least, bring documentation of your job offer with its start date, and preferably also tickets for the short trip to Canada or Mexico. CANNOTANSWER",

I'm not quite certain why this is so, but probably because it seems to be illegal to take more tögrög out of the country than you bring in, so there's no easy way for an overseas bank to gain a supply of tögrög to sell to you. (But don't worry about getting into trouble taking a few left-over notes out of the country.) ATMs are plentiful in central Ulaanbaatar. They're often inside banks, rather than on outside walls, and are typically labelled 'ATM' or 'банкомат'. I had no difficulty using a British bank card there. If your first stop in Mongolia is Ulaanbaatar, you won't have any difficulty obtaining currency. If you arrive by train, then it's normal for a man to come down the train selling tögrög in exchange for various currencies. I brought some US dollars with me for that purpose, as that tends to be the most easily traded currency. CANNOTANSWER",

There are really only two airlines to get you from SAO to AKL, and they're Qantas and LAN, who each code-share the other's flights. LAN's fares are usually cheaper tha Qantas, even for exactly the same flight (ie a LAN-marketed-fare on a Qantas-operated flight). The service and amenities in business at least are almost identical on both the LAN and Qantas flights out of Santiago (SCL). In economy I suspect Qantas will be better, as I don't think LAN have seat-back entertainment in economy. Because of the lack of competition on these routes, you will not find great variance between days of the week, especially if booking from further out. As the date gets closer, the weekends and Monday and Friday tend to book up, leaving only the higher fare classes aqvailable, so 1-4 weeks out you may see perhaps as much as a 20-30% difference in fare between a mid-week flight and the other days. But this depends entirely on what has filled up. I recommend you book a LAN-marketed flight on Qantas metal, via an OTA such as Expedia. This is likely to be the best value. CANNOTANSWER",

      "background": "My problem: I recently booked a business trip about three months out, noticing slightly too late that there's a huge event (Formula 1 race) happening in town the previous weekend and all the remotely convenient and/or comfortable hotels are asking crazy rates (US$500+).\n\nThe usual rule of thumb of booking flights and hotels is the earlier the better, since prices usually go up but rarely come down.  In this case, though, I have a sneaky suspicion that hotels may be demanding too much and there may be a fire sale of unsold inventory right before the event.\n\nSo: Do hotel prices generally go down right before big events? Bonus points for answers with data instead of just speculation.\n\n(Note: this question has been edited, as I'm more interested in the general question above than the specifics of my situation.)\n\nInterim answer 1: I've followed simbabque's answer and booked a mildly inconvenient and mildly crappy but fully cancellable and not crazy expensive hotel to cover my ass, and will check & report back on the hotel situation before arrival.\n\nInterim answer 2: Idly poking around, I noticed that a big chain hotel near the office that had previously been 100% full had a room free for all three nights at our normal corporate rate (~US$120).  Booked!  But I'll still check before arrival and report back for science.\n\nVery overdue final update: I didn't do a very thorough check because work, but a casual browse on Google Hotels did show a bunch of hotels offering rooms at less stratospheric prices (under $300). YMMV.\n",

Business-oriented booking sites sometimes even have cancellation up to early evening of first day of the stay. (HRS.de is advertising this on TV right now in Germany as their main feature). I would pay the few more dollars for that, get a room at the expensive rate, and then check back regularly, maybe even on the day you arrive. As soon as you find something reasonably cheap, cancel the expensive one. This also works for flights, but those are often paid in advance, so you would have to fork out a lot of money to do that up front. Also check international booking portals. You don't have to make your hotel booking through a booking portal that targets your country. As mentioned in the comments, if you are not responsible for booking in your corporate setting, clarify this with your management, HR or whoever is in charge of booking, and have them do it.

Can I get a visa on arrival and then extend it for the required days?\n\nI am reading conflicting information on sites. Some say that visas that are obtained on arrival cannot be extended. Others say it is fine. Not sure what to trust.\n\nI don't have lots of time before I leave (13th of May) so will I have time to apply for one online?\n\nUPDATE AFTER MY TRIP: \n\nHere is the process that we went through whilst in Bali.\n\n\nWhen you land, before you get your luggage you will have to pass through Immigration. There will most likely be a massive queue for the FREE 30 Day Visa - you don't want this one - you want to pay for a 30 day visa so that you can extend it later. There will be little desks at which you can pay for it. The price is about $35. They give you a little piece of paper that says Visa on it and they point you to the immigration desk. A member of staff there will question your stay (standard procedure: where yourt hotel is, what you are doing here etc...). They will stamp your passport and let you though. \nTwo weeks into our stay we went to the Immigration Office located in Jimbaran. On your first day there you will need to bring with you the following:\n\n\n  2 copies of the ID page in your passport\n  \n  2 copies of the visa page in your passport\n  \n  Your passport\n  \n  Confirmations of hotels/flights (not 100% neccessary but good to have)\n\n\nAt the desk you first see, ask for a Visa Extension form. Fill it out.\n\nThere is a machine which hands out tickets. Ask a member of staff which button to press as the tickets vary depending on what you're there for and most of the options are coded with abbreviations that no-one understands.\n\nYou get your ticket and wait to be called up. They will take your documents and passport. They will then give you a day about A WEEK LATER to come back. KEEP THE DOCUMENTS GIVEN TO YOU SAFE! YOU ARE NOW PASSPORTLESS AND THIS PIECE OF PAPER IS ALL YOU GOT. \nYou come back on the given date. On this day they will ask for payment (355,000 IDR) and they will take your photo and fingerprints. You once again need a ticket and so on... You will be given some documents which get passed around the different officials you will encounter and they get stamped a couple of times. You will once again be given a return date about a week later.\nFinal day. You come to collect your passport. You go to a little side window (ask a member of staff: just say you are here to collect your passport and they will point you in the right direction). You give the forms you have. They just tell you to sit down. At this point you just need to wait and carefully listen out for your name; they are prone to mispronunciations! They will give you your passport and in the visa page you will see a new stamp that says your stay is valid until a much later date. Done!\n\n\nHere is blog post I found that explains a similar process\n",

This includes one where the room is described as en-suite. The site offers no definition. It seems to be a general hotel-site category, rather than something specific to these hotels.\n\nWhat does this mean? Is the bathroom partially open because the door doesn't fit the doorway? \n\nOr is there a viewing gallery for spectators? \n\nOr is one wall missing? \n\n\n\nI'm aware of the unfortunate existence of \"open concept bathrooms\" or \"open-plan bathrooms\", where paying couples are made to hear, smell and (if they don't studiously look away) see each other doing things that humans were intended to do in private, described accurately here as \"the ultimate hotel horror\". Is this that?  \n\n\n\nI've tried looking online but the results are inconclusive:\n\n\nThis tripadvisor question's answer completely misunderstands the question\nOne random person on Yahoo Answers says it's a bathroom with no door or a glass or what sounds like a \"Wild West\" style saloon door\n\n",

However, they are rated for 120V at 60Hz while the only reasonably priced transformers change the voltage to ~120V, 50Hz. I am not sure what else to do because I have have severe breathing issues and even my skin reacts to something there (hard to figure out what this is). A 50 to 60Hz transformer would be more expensive than ordering a new filter from the UK (I can't seem to find these filters anywhere in Europe except on amazon.co.uk), which I would like to avoid doing. \n\n\n  Will a ~50W motor (120V, 60Hz) accept 120V, 50Hz power without issue, especially since this is in a fan, which ought to keep it cool? \n\n",

          "context": "The answer is unfortunately not as simple as stated by CMaster. If the device contains an AC motor directly driven by the mains voltage, reducing the mains frequency will indeed cause the motor to rotate slower, but it may also overload the motor. It is difficult to easily explain the physics behind this, but basically, a motor needs a larger magnetic core to run on a lower AC frequency. If the magnetic core is not large enough, it might saturate during the AC cycle (with is longer if the frequency is lower), cause a significant current increase and finally the motor to overheat. Electrical motors are also often cooled by a fan attached to the motor shaft, so reducing the rotation speed of the motor may lead to insufficient cooling of the motor block itself. The issue with the physical dimension of the magnetic core also applies to transformers. If the device contains a transformer designed for 60Hz, it may overload if operated on 50Hz. Without knowing the exact design of your device, it is impossible to answer your question. If you won't risk the device to break or in worst case overheat and catch fire, your only reasonable option is the get a confirmation from the manufacturer, that the device can be safely used on 50Hz mains.

This train consists of so-called \"Kurswagen\" - the individual cars go on different routes. In Salzburg cars get changed between trains. According to the schedule for early June: There is one train coming from Zurich via Innsbruck to Salzburg. This one gets split up into a part going to Budapest (EN 40467) and a part going to Vienna (NJ 467) as well as your train (EN 50467) to Praha. Additionally, there is one train arriving from Munich (EN 463) that gets coupled to (EN 40467) and travels as one unit to Budapest. For the sleeper cars, you will have a reservation and this one will be in the right car. So, remember which car is yours or you might have to explore the beautiful city of Vienna instead of the equally beautiful Praha the next morning. On the other hand, at 3 a.m. you should be sleeping. The name change to S 1540 is probably due to the fact that the train is operated by the Czech railway from Linz on. This means that train crew changes and sometimes the engine is changed as well.

      "background": "In September 2012, I travelled by speedboat from Gásluokta/Kjøpsvik to Vuodnabahta/Hellemobotn in Divtasvuona/Tysfjord, Norway.  One of the timetabled stops along the way is Tjierrekluokta/Nordbukta.  To my surprise, the boat at one point stopped seemingly in the middle of the fjord, in the pitch black darkness of a late September evening.  After half a minute or so, a small boat came rowing from the void, took one passenger and his luggage, and rowed back.  I asked other passengers, and they said that since there is no pier in Tjierrekluokta/Nordbukta, travellers have to do the last bit my themselves, rowing.\n\nWell, this information was not at all reported in the timetable.  Fortunately the place where we were starting our hike (Vuodnabahta/Hellemobotn) did have a pier and we could simply get there.  Is there any resource from where I can tell whether I need to make special arrangements to reach a particular timetabled stop for a boat?  Or does the company operating the boats take care of this if people cannot arrange it by themselves?  Is the situation I describe rather unique, or does this more commonly occur in rural boat routes in Norway?\n",

He would then sail right up close to our pier, and we would jump ashore before he reversed out. When we wanted to go home, we would contact the ferryman by radio, and he would pick us up on his next scheduled trip. Today, the island close to ours is road-connected, so now we simply have a small boat there to travel the last leg. I saw something similar on Svalbard. We were on a guided tour, when the boat stopped in the fjord to pick up people by a RIB they lowered from the ship (likely locals who had been visiting their cabin). However, as far as I'm aware, this is only necesarry when your final destination is not land-connected, and you make personal arrangements. The fact that it's actually on the time table sounds strange. It might be a personal arrangement with a local who commute to the main land, and the time table is simply there for his convenience. I assume that if you ordered a ticket to a island that did not have a pier, they would inform you that you would need to arrange pickup (if they do not offer it themselves). CANNOTANSWER",

When I came to the check-in counter, handed my passport to the representatives to print me my boarding pass and check my luggage in, they told me I needed a transit visa transiting through Canada, not going through Germany, therefore they did not check me in nor gave me my boarding pass. I checked Canadian embassy whether I needed a transit visa it says YES. below is the snapshot:\n\n \n\nThen I tried calling the Canadian consulate in Moscow but there wasn't anyone assisting visa questions.

At the end I was forced to buy new tickets to fly to the U.S. My questions or was my ticketing agency supposed totl inform me via email to get a transit visa? Was it a legit reason for the representative at a check-in counter in Moscow not allowing me to use my ticket? Would I have a good reason to claim a report for some kind of refund saying the agency didn't inform me I needed a transit visa? Or is it always up to the travelers to know they need it? \n\nThanks!

And now I'm booking four seats instead of one, I really need to keep the prices down so I'm looking at budget flights.\n\nI was very surprised to find that the cheapest British Airways tickets seem to allow no hold luggage at all - just two small cabin bags. So surprised that I couldn't quite believe it was true. But that does indeed seem to be the case.\n\nSo I went back to budget airlines and found a good price going out on EasyJet and back on BMI. I presumed these would have hold luggage in the price but, scanning the terms and conditions for these airlines, I'm now to so sure.\n\nThe question then is: do budget tickets now commonly exclude any hold luggage at all?

This meant that if people did try to sneak in, they'd either have to climb the ladder to the cubby hole and drag down my backpack without waking any of the four people sleeping there, or else climb over me to get to my daypack. It was pretty safe, and I never felt worried.

The reason they can do this because the number they allocate you is a UK \"non-geographic\" number, which charge a premium to the caller, and GoSim receive a percentage of that premium - basically the caller is subsidizing the call so that you can receive it for free. Some other similar companies work on the same principle but instead use numbers from the Isle of Man or Estonia. (GoSim used to use Estonia +372 numbers, but changed a year or so ago). GoSim also give the option of a US number, which may be more convenient and frequently cheaper for the caller depending on what country they they are calling from, however you will be charged to receive the call whenever someone calls you on that number.

An izakaya is literally a \"stay-sake-shop\" (居酒屋), meaning a place that sells alcohol for consumption on premises. And because you traditionally eat while you drink in Japan, izakayas serve food, and I'd even posit that this is the dividing line between a izakaya and a (Western-style) bar, not the location or presence of the bar. Delineating where an izakaya ends and a restaurant starts is an even tougher exercise. I like @TheWanderingCoder's definition of izakayas being primarily for drinking, while restaurants are primarily for eating, but even that can be a pretty fuzzy line in both directions: there are plenty of \"gourmet izakayas\" that would be restaurants if they called themselves that, and (for example) yakiniku grilled-meat restaurants that also offer all-you-can-drink deals and are primarily intended for people who want to get hammered.

It's anecdotal but I have heard many reports about people being denied entry to the US based on repeated travel to \"unfriendly\" countries, never to European countries (and especially not to the Schengen area). Generally speaking, there is a sharp distinction in the US between citizens and residents, whose rights enjoy strong legal protections, and foreigners, for whom everything goes, especially at the border. Not so in the EU. It's not to say that EU countries are exemplary (they are not, you can find many egregious examples of that) but there is an expectation of due process at the border and a rather restrictive list of valid reasons to deny entry. Denying entry based solely on your having visited a third country is not common practice and would probably not be legal. Beyond fraud and intent to immigrate illegally, the main reason to deny entry is that you present a threat to public safety and the hurdle for that is higher than just having visited a country.

Click “search” and wait five minutes or more and see a table of five hundred flights with accurate fares. Pick one and book it. NOW, it says NOBODY flies from USA to Taiwan or Europe or Korea, and only Southwest flies within North America. Skyscanner, for comparison, makes you pick one origin and destination before estimating prices, and then a specific date to find the real price.\n\nAnyone familiar with Azuon and aware of something similar?\n\nYes, Skyscanner is similar, but not close in value, primarily because it makes you select a single origin and destination before it shows prices, and those prices are always very inaccurate estimates.\n\nazair.com is closer, but it doesn't know some airports exist, its user-interface is clumsy, and it often complains that some problem prevented it returning results.\n\nUpdates: Azuon has made some bug fixes and some of the problems have gone away.  But it still said \"no fares found\" for any Korean airport to any US airport for the entire month of March.  As for AzAir.com, yesterday it offered me a dozen flights USA to Spain for $1.99 !! (Of course, they all got error messages from the actual airline.) \n\nWell, I guess the answer is either go back to the old method of spending a hundred dollars worth of time to save a hundred fifty; or just hire someone like chimpando.

It is a wrong idea to think that most Spanish have a siesta time, it happened some decades ago, but today is not a generalized practice. Anyway, you have to difference between siesta time and business timetables. Probably Spanish timetables are influenced by siesta tradition, but you have to take into account other elements like the high temperatures we have in summer or the big meal we take around 2 o'clock. Given this, you have to worry from 13:30 to 17:30. These 4 hours are the most problematic, but I don't know any petrol station closed on this hours (in fact most petrol stations are open 24 hours a day), restaurants usually close at 4pm except in touristic areas where the restaurants adapt their schedules to the tourists they receive.

United booked the flight with LAN air, the Peruvian airline.\n\nBoth companies say that they are unable to change the name because of TSA restrictions not allowing a name change. I asked if I could just cancel and re-book, but United said they could not do this because there are multiple airlines involved.\n\nA note has been attached to the reservation explaining the issue, and the United rep said that they would be able to print her boarding pass with the correct name. However, he said there are no guarantees that she'll be able to fly because although the boarding pass will be correct, the ticket will still have the reversed name.\n\nI was prepared to just take the chance that it will all work out, seeing how it's really obvious the name is just backwards, but with recent events I'm worried that US airport security is going to be extra strict for the next little while.\n\nIs this something I need to worry about, or are chances good that this will work out fine?\n\nThe United rep said there's a chance we could cancel the United flights and get a new ticket with the correct name for no cost, but we'd have to pay for new tickets within Peru ($500 out of the total $1300 ticket cost).

The other lane is empty. This is scary.\n\nAre there cabs available all the time there, or do I have to book a taxi before arriving at La Défense? If I have to book it, is it better to do it a few minutes before arriving, or should I do it the day before my trip?\n\n\n\nAfter being at La Défense for five consecutive times near 9 AM and 9:30 AM, I confirm that there were always a lot of cabs available (always at least five, often more). I believe that this was also the case near 4 PM. Of course, the situation may be different on weekends.\n",

Ease of finding a taxi will depend on the time of day and day of week. In general you should not have any issues, however there's likely times of the week when you may have some trouble, such as early in the day, especially on a weekend. Thankfully there's an easy solution. Very close to the Defense station are two hotels - the Sofitel next to the Metro station, and the Renaissance a very short walk away. Both of these should have taxis available most of the day, or will be able to arrange one for you if they don't. (Ironically on my first ever trip to France I was headed to the Renaissance and my taxi driver got lost finding it! I think we drove around the \"loop\" 3 or 4 times before he finally managed to find the right exit!) CANNOTANSWER",

The distance from Moscow to London is about 2500km and the delay in London was obviously more than 3 hours, since you had to spend a night in Amsterdam. You may do as lastminute.com is suggesting and mandate AirHelp to claim the compensation. AirHelp will charge at least 100€ for this service. You may also continue with the claim yourself, depending on where you live, perhaps get free help from public consumer protection organizations in the country you are living, go to any of the other AirHelp-like service providers or order a lawyer to present your case (which may actually be cheaper than using AirHelp or other service providers).

Are they kept somewhere? Can they be recovered?\n\nThis time it probably not worth the hassle but since this never happened to me after decades of flying into over 50 countries, I felt confused a frustrated at the lack of transparency. Specifically, they took out all AA batteries from inside items (a pair of Lithium AAs in a flashlight and NiMh AAs that were in some children toys), a bag of sweets and a box of chocolates. Nothing that we had not taken with us before. Oddly, a 9V Lithium battery was not removed from the only item that had a screw holding the battery compartment door closed.\n",

Since I didn't have the I-20 at the time and I didn't want to postpone my trip, I submitted a fake I-20. \n\nThey granted me a visa but after a few days, called me back to tell me that my I-20 was deemed to have been forged and thus my visa had been annulled. The official reason on the rejection letter listed was \"The information submitted regarding the justification for the purpose and conditions of the \nintended stay was not reliable\". The consular official invited me to appeal the decision with genuine documents if I wished to but I've decided to simply cancel my trip for now.\n\nI realize this was an insanely stupid thing to do and in hindsight, I wish I hadn't done it. I have since been issued a valid US F1 visa and also have my genuine I20.

This will weight negatively against any Schengen visa application you might submit in the (near?) future.

It's just that they are going to be particularly careful when evaluating your application. Actual bans typically have a limited duration and often last for one to three years, at least if you haven't been found guilty of a crime. So even if that would happen, it would still not preclude you from ever getting a Schengen visa. But it would obviously make things more difficult. CANNOTANSWER",

As some of the suitcases are probably very heavy, and as my suitcase will be stored there for a few months, I am wondering about the correct way to store the luggage to minimize the damage for the suitcases at the bottom of the pile. Should the cases be stacked sideways (as depicted in this image) or should they be stacked with the largest face pointing up (as depicted in this image)?

          "context": "Simple answer: It depends! In general, in physics, pressure on shorter structures has less chances of bending/breaking them. For exmaple, you can bend a metal stick of 1m length easier than a nail of the same diameter. So if you have pressure coming from above, the shortest edges should be vertical to maximise the resistance against the pressure. If you have a smaller luggage, the difference in centimeter between the various sides is smaller and therefore it does not matter so much which side it is on. Chances are high that the luggage will lie on top of others, or that luggages on top will be larger and therefore the pressure will not be on a small spot in a large surface but rather covering the whole surface of your luggage and thus the pressure is on the outer frame which is more stable than the center of the surface. However if you have a very large (and thin) luggage, you might not want to lie it on the larger surface since chances are high that a luggage lying on top is smaller and therefore not putting pressure on the more stable outer edges of the frame but on the softer center of the cover. The luggage might deform over time. CANNOTANSWER",

      "background": "I am trying to use Google Maps in China. I know that Google is blocked, which is why I downloaded the map of Beijing offline. However, when I open the app my phone attempts to find GPS satellites but finds none. I know location works because my location works fine when I am on WiFi. Is this a China blocking GPS thing or something else?\n\nI am using a Verizon HTC One (M8) with Android 5.0.1 and HTC Sense.\n\nNote: This question has also been cross-posted to Android.SE.\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nAll my testing for this question was done on the 7th floor of a downtown office building. Yesterday after waiting a while, I was able to recieve GPS signal (using both Google Maps and GPS Status) while on the 17th floor of a suburban apartment building. I was then also able to recieve signal in another part of downtown that lacked many tall buildings. When I get back to the office tomorrow I will be able to judge if it was just taking a mega-long time to get the satellite data as @Vince suggested, or if it is the urban canyon as @Loren suggested. Thank you all for the help and explanations!\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nAfter some testing, it seems that this does simply come down to an urban canyon problem. The GPS does not find any satellites at my desk in the office, however, if I bring it next to a window it finds 2 satellites (not enough for a location, but enough to answer this question). When I take the phone outside the building I am able to get location in some areas. Thank you all again for the help and the wealth of new knowledge. \n\nNote: all testing was done with data and WiFi services turned off.\n\nBased on a comment, I have asked a question in GIS.SE asking about the urban canyon and how it compares to Beijing versus NYC.\n",

This is required for my case, because as soon as you enter an Indian airport with a low cost airline you have to pass immigration. No matter if you have an other international flight from the same airport a few hours later or not. ( Together with the next sentence, I assume that the terminals are designed in a special way that makes this the case) They also told me, that I wouldn't have had this problem if I would have chosen a five star airline for my flight to India as I did for my connecting flight. If you arrive with such a premium airline you don't have to pass immigration to catch a connecting flight ( I assume this should also be a premium airline). I couldn't find this information on the web, nor did the staff at the Indian embassy in Berlin tell me (I contacted them before I my flights) All these Information are based on what the AirAsia staff told me. So in the end I had to book a new flight. CANNOTANSWER",

If you decide to get a US sim, quite a few of them are available on eBay so you can buy and get it setup and tested before you leave so if you have to get your phone unlocked you can do it at home, and that will get you more towards your desired pricing but I found they were still much more expensive than UK pay as you go SIMs, also make sure your phone is unlocked IE Not locked to your local phone provider.

Assuming that you booked both legs separately (i.e., they are on separate tickets), you roughly need about 2 hours in Frankfurt, as you will need to take the luggage from the belt and bring it to Lufthansa check-in. According to their web-page, check-in closes 40 minutes before departure, but since the flight is to the US, you should be there way earlier (my guess: 90 minutes). Getting from the gate to the belt is quite quick, as passport checks (if conducted) are quick. After the check-in, you will need to go through security again. Passport checks are typically quite quick. Having said that, the 2 hours are just a rough figure and by no means a good guideline. I would personally never book a seperate-ticket connection if the connection time is not at least 5 hours. If your incoming flight is delayed, your out-going one (from Frankfurt) is void, including the return trip. Also, you may be taken to the gate from the plane by bus, which costs extra time. If both flights are on the same ticket, then do not worry - the travel agent or the web-site has already checked that the minimum connection time has been met and if your incoming flight is delayed, you will be rebooked free of charge.

      "title": "Is the ban on applying for a US visa after marriage fraud a lifetime ban or 10 years?",
      "background": "A Jamaican committed marriage fraud about 30 years ago by marrying a US citizen in a marriage where the groom was paid a certain amount of money to marry her. The groom got in legal trouble for an unrelated matter, and the marriage fraud was discovered and the family friend was deported back to Jamaica. She no longer has any paperwork involved with the deportation and she can't remember any of the details. I do not know if she simply agreed to return to Jamica when the fraud was discovered, or if she made any attempts to mount any type of legal defense in the case. I do know that she was cooperative with the immigration authorities and that they did not have to come looking for her.\nShe would like to come the USA for a two-week visit. The main purpose of the visit is for her to visit a friend (US citizen) who is terminally ill.\n\nI have been looking at 8 U.S.C. 1182 and from my reading of it, it would seem that she would not be admissible to the US because of the previous immigration fraud. My understanding is based on the section that says:\n\n\n  In general.-Any alien who, by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact, seeks to procure (or has sought to procure or has procured) a visa, other documentation, or admission into the United States or other benefit provided under this Act is inadmissible.\n\n\nWhat's not clear to me is if this means that she would be inadmissible permanently or if this would be subject to the 10 year limit.  Can anyone help provide some clarity on this?  If the ban is not permanent are there any tips to being able to increase her chances of being able to get a visa.  She intends to honestly answer all questions during her application process for a visa.\n",

          "context": "Yes, the ban for fraud or willful misrepresentation, in INA 212(a)(6)(C)(i), is a lifetime ban. Whenever the law says that someone is \"inadmissible\" without any other qualification, that means it is a lifetime ban (i.e. the person will still be inadmissible no matter how much time has passed). For the bans that last a fixed amount of time, the law says something like \"an alien who ... who again seeks admission within X years of ... is inadmissible\"; this means that it is an X-year ban (i.e. it only makes the person inadmissible for an attempt to seek entry within X years of the start of the ban). Since she is under a ban, if she wants to go to the US, she will need a waiver. Since she is going as a nonimmigrant visitor, she will need a nonimmigrant waiver (under INA 212(d)(3)(A)). There is no separate form to apply for this. Rather, she will apply for a visitor visa as usual, and if it is denied solely due to a ban (and not due to failure to overcome \"immigrant intent\", which has no waiver), the consular officer adjudicating her visa will inform her of the steps to apply for a waiver, which will be decided by that same officer.

      "background": "Wiki gives us the following explanation of the use of high beams in a car:\n\n\n  Main-beam (also called high, driving, or full beam) headlamps provide an intense, centre-weighted distribution of light with no particular control of glare. Therefore, they are only suitable for use when alone on the road, as the glare they produce will dazzle other drivers.\n\n\nBut what if you drive at night on a fully separated highway, such as the Autobahn? Are you allowed to turn on the high beams? I assume the middle barrier will prevent other drivers from getting blinded, but perhaps it would also be annoying to the drivers in the front?\n",

        {
          "context": "Definitely do not use your high beams if there is a car in front of you. It will distract them or send a message of intimidation. As for the cars coming towards you, this depends on the distance between the two sets of lanes, and the height of the barrier. As a simple rule of thumb, if you can see the headlights on the oncoming cars, they can see yours. Don't use your high beams. If you can't see their headlights, go ahead and turn your brights on. (Trucks may be able to see and suffer glare from your headlights even in situations where cars cannot; if you can see the windshields of trucks, or if trucks are flashing their headlights at you, stop using your high beams.) I drive on empty country roads, divided and not, and have done so for 40 years. These are my rules and I have never had a driver \"flash\" at me to lower my lights unless I have absent-mindedly forgotten to lower them (that is, never when I thought it would be ok to have them on) and neither have I had a \"wow, almost didn't see that\" moment from not having high beams on.

The new changes are: \n\n19h50 Zhangjiajie - 21h30 Guangzhou\nA stop for 11h10 (so +1 day)\n8h40 Guangzhou - 10h25 Chiang Mai \n\nThis is clearly a disadvantage for me, because I don't want less time in Chiang Mai and I don't want more time in Zhangjiajie. So I replied and said that I didn't agree with the changes and I just got a response stating that this is my best option. \n\n\nAm I allowed to ask for some sort of compensation, because of this? Although it's probably the China Southern Airlines' responsibility. \nOr could I ask them to put me on a flight earlier which has a stop in Guangzhou for 18 hours, so I can at least explore the city a bit? \nAre there other options or factors I should keep in mind or that I can do? \n\n\nNote: My other flight from Brussels to Beijing with Hainan Airlines (using the same booking agent) also changed 2 days ago, but the changes were not that drastic. \n\nEdit: I ended up getting a flight a day earlier (which I mailed them for) so I had 18 hours in Guangzhou so I can explore it a little bit. They had to check this first with the airlines and it was approved. Since it was a change of the airlines (which they can apparently make any time) I didn't get a compensation or something. \n",

That's also the norm for major changes to a flight. Your description of the conversation so far sounds like that of an agent who knows he has to give you a full refund if you ask, but is trying to persuade you to keep on the flight. If there is another flight that you could book and do what you want, then ask for a full refund and use the money to book that flight. Alternatively you could try to negotiate with the airline, telling them you are considering asking for a full refund, but you will stay on the flight if they make it worth your while. There is no telling how successful that might be - if there aren't many alternative flights then probably not very. However you might get some extra flyer miles, or a future travel voucher if you are lucky. If it makes you feel better, you are a long way from the only person airlines do this to. CANNOTANSWER",

The flight details were as followed: \n\n9h50 Zhangjiajie - 11h25 Guangzhou\nA stop for 4h35\n16h00 Guangzhou - 17h50 Chiang Mai \n\nYesterday the booking agent mailed me stating that China Southern Airlines changed their flights and asked me to send them an agreement for the proposed changes. The new changes are: \n\n19h50 Zhangjiajie - 21h30 Guangzhou\nA stop for 11h10 (so +1 day)\n8h40 Guangzhou - 10h25 Chiang Mai \n\nThis is clearly a disadvantage for me, because I don't want less time in Chiang Mai and I don't want more time in Zhangjiajie. So I replied and said that I didn't agree with the changes and I just got a response stating that this is my best option. \n\n\nAm I allowed to ask for some sort of compensation, because of this? Although it's probably the China Southern Airlines' responsibility. \nOr could I ask them to put me on a flight earlier which has a stop in Guangzhou for 18 hours, so I can at least explore the city a bit? \nAre there other options or factors I should keep in mind or that I can do? \n\n\nNote: My other flight from Brussels to Beijing with Hainan Airlines (using the same booking agent) also changed 2 days ago, but the changes were not that drastic. \n\nEdit: I ended up getting a flight a day earlier (which I mailed them for) so I had 18 hours in Guangzhou so I can explore it a little bit. They had to check this first with the airlines and it was approved. Since it was a change of the airlines (which they can apparently make any time) I didn't get a compensation or something. \n",

To makes things simpler, he's been living in Paris for years now and has no ties to anyone involved in politics in Lebanon. \n\nCan he visit Israel with only a Lebanese passport? Also, even if he asks the Israel customs not to stamp his passport, can Lebanon find out he's been in Israel? Can he get in trouble when he decides to visit Lebanon?\n",

Entering Israel, like any other state, requires permission in the form of a valid visa, unless it's for specific reasons by citizens of specific countries. As an enemy state, Lebanon is obviously not one of the countries exempt from a visa. But, it's Israel's policy to allow everyone, including citizens of enemy states to apply for a visa. He should contact the Israeli representatives in France to start the process. Again, he can start the visa process. It's not guaranteed that he will be approved for one. Finally, regarding Lebanese authorities finding out, Israel doesn't stamp passports but gives slips of paper, so there is no problem there, but he must make sure to not enter from the land crossing from Egypt or Jordan as the Egyptian/Jordanian authorities will stamp the passport with a stamp from a border crossing with Israel. Also, usually visas are put in the passport; obviously an Israeli visa in the passport is a dead give away, so he would need to ask during the visa process if it's possible to not attach to the passport. And, depending on his notoriety he would need to look out for public signs that he has been to Israel. For example, posting a picture from Tel Aviv as your FB profile picture is probably not a good idea. CANNOTANSWER",

Also some airplanes have drinking water taps so you can fill your own water bottle, and even if they don't, often you can ask for it to be filled when the cart comes around and they will (with water, anyway.) I have also asked while we were still loading passengers to have my water bottle filled and it has worked. On trips where I didn't bring a bottle but was very thirsty, I have also asked for \"two glasses of water please\" and again I have never been denied. CANNOTANSWER",

I am well aware of what fees my Norwegian bank imposes, and I am not asking about those.\n\n\nHow common is it to be charged such local fees when paying in shops, restaurants, hotels, etc. in these cities?\nIf such fees are charged, how can one be informed about which establishments charge them, how much they are, etc?\nCan you typically see it on the screen of the payment machine while paying, for example?\n\n",

I've used both Russian ussued card and foreign issued cards. According the Russian law, the business must notify it's clients about all the fees, so you should just ask about additional fees and other charges before paying for something. However, things are changing when we're talking about businesses proving some service, like delivery, translation, etc. they may charge you for some forms of payment, including the card. This is a common thing for those who uses some kind of software to transfer the money, online retailers, for example. Banks wil definitely charge you to get money from your card with cashier, but **some of ATM may not charge you additionally (eg, Citibank usually don't charge other's bank cards). ATM will notify you it there will be additional charge before the transaction. CANNOTANSWER",

The train stopped and Ukrainian border control folks came in. They had small (for that time) devices connected to laptops which they've used to scan passports of the passengers and apparently check if a passenger was in any kind of a database they'd be interested in. 15 min later Russian border control came in with those huge books and asked for my full name. Then opened the book on the page tagged with the letter my last name begins with and started manually scanning it trying to find a handwritten match. Needless to say, it made us laugh like a bunch of kids on a caffeine. CANNOTANSWER",

Furthermore, Egyptians are born with the ability to know foreigners, I am an Arab who looks like any Egyptian and wears the same clothes and they still spot me and know that I am a foreigner. In addition to that, from your description of yourself and as Rory has commented, it will be hard for you to blend in easily. My advice to you, wear whatever clothes you wear at home (unless you are from an African tribe that wears nothing) and act normal and you will be just fine. Also, try not wear anything that shows your tattoos in Egypt, tattoos are for criminals in Egypt so showing them means you are either a criminal or a foreigner. CANNOTANSWER",

So no real motivation to sell discounted seats (especially since last minute for business needs can truly be last minute). The route you are looking, USA to southern Europe, will be busy in spring, so the cheapest seats are likely selling well already. You could try a broad search, say til 1 June, find the cheapest ticket and then try to standby for an earlier departure. Or two, just bite the bullet and book the best fare for the dates you want to go. But \"standby fares\" went the way of the dinosaurs with paper tickets ;-) CANNOTANSWER",

However, now I wonder if it is possible to decline the alternative ticket handed at the check-in counter. I usually book an onward ticket as well as my room in advance before stating that I like to get off at the transit airport; even the airline staff told me that I must state it at the check-in counter since they don't accept it via a phone call or email in advance.\n\nSo can I decline the alternative ticket? If not, is it the airline or I that should book another ticket that can get me off at the transit airport?\n",

This leads me to believe that tribes don't have much presence, anymore.\n\nAddendum: I'm from California, so I'm familiar with Indian casinos, but a quick search of Indian museums in California shows some around all the major metro areas. I can also find websites of tribes in California that advertise public cultural events. I expected to find similar things in New England.

Rather, they offer you unlimited rides only between two predefined stations along a particular line (or combination of lines). In addition, they include a free transfer to lite rail lines in Newark and Hudson/Bergen counties and single-zone NJ Transit busses for last-mile connections. Because of this, the price of a weekly pass varies wildly depending on what stations you are riding between. For example, Hazlet to NY Penn Station is a 133 dollar weekly ticket. Secaucus Junction to NY Penn, by contrast, is 38.50. To find the fare for your particular route, on the NJ Transit Website, click the \"schedules and fares\" link at the top left and select the two stations in which you're interested.

Often in an inner city area, all roads will abide by the lower speed limit noted when entering the city limits, but not all will have speed limit signs. Some speed zones are named, such as a school zone or safety zone. These reduced speed areas will often only have an \"end of school zone\" type sign and not a speed limit sign.

Unfortunately for visitors to an area, speed limits are not always posted on every road, so one needs to pay attention to the signs you do see and their relationship to civilization, two lane roads in housing areas, neighborhoods often have the lowest speeds 25-35, two lane roads in business areas a bit higher 35-45, four lane roads in the city 50/55, outside the city 65/70.

I'm starting to look for health (or travel) insurance in my country (Chile) to leave with a little more peace of mind.\n\nWhen I was looking for insurance, the first result got me to this company and it says\n\n\n  [...] a low cost and comprehensive health and travel insurance that meets NZ Immigration requirements.\n  It is compulsory for Working Holiday Visa holders coming to NZ to work in retail, fruit picking, or hospitality industries to provide evidence of comprehensive travel insurance while they are in New Zealand\n\n\nI haven't realized it was compulsory to have health insurance to go. And sure enough, I went and read the inmigration website once more\n\n\n  To be eligible [...] hold medical and comprehensive hospitalisation insurance for the length of your stay\n\n\neven though in the actual visa I got it didn't refer to health anywhere, except maybe\n\n\n  You may also be asked to provide evidence of any other conditions that you were required to meet as part of the working holiday scheme under which you submitted your application.\n\n\nSo, ok, I have to get health insurance. But that leaves me with a whole lot more of questions:\n\n\nDoes anyone know if they'll check it coming in our out of the country?\nAnd what is considered \"comprehensive hospitalization\"? Should I worry about how much does my insurance cover to know if NZ considers it \"comprehensive\" and let me enter the country?\nDoes it matter where I get my insurance, Chile or NZ (don't even know if I can do that from Chile)? I mean, can I arrive in NZ and ask for insurance there or won't I even be allowed out of the airport without one?\nDoes the insurance has to be for the length of my stay? I don't even have return tickets so I can't really give a date. Most insurance companies in Chile give and estimate for max of 60 days. Can I get and insurance in Chile for those 60 days and look for other insurance in NZ after those 60 days?\n\n\nI know those are a lot of questions and I'm supposed to post one question per... well, post, but they all relate to the exact same thing: what does \"comprehensive hospitalization\" means? What are my limitations or exact requirements to decide for an insurance plan or the other? I don't want to pay for a plan and then realize it isn't really what NZ wants and kicks me out...\n",

I asked to the company for a certificate to show in the customs, but when I arrived to NZ, nobody asked me for it (neither the minimal money, BTW). As far as I know, this is completely random, because in NZ I asked some people, and none of them told me in that moment (2011) that someone asked for papers validating that they had money or insurance, but a few of them told me that they knew someone who had been asked for those papers. My recommendation, just to be sure: contract your insurance in Chile. It's cheaper than in NZ, and for the whole time you're going to stay, it's better to be safe than sorry. Besides, you could have a bad moment in customs, or in the worst case, they could send you back to Chile. CANNOTANSWER",

      "background": "Me and my family were planning for a Trip to USA / Canada this year... So all the travel documents including documents required for the USA Visa were collected and uploaded to the website. My brother is handing all this, and we've had to delay the Visa Interview Appointment once in May this year…\n\nNow I've been travelling within India a lot this year… and have to travel again in July. My dad's not been feeling alright lately, so we've decided to plan this tour for next year… or only my brother and his wife will be going, we'll stay back this year. \n\nI'm planning to travel somewhere again within India next month, but the visa interview appointment is making me wait until post-15th July. I asked my brother why this interview cannot be delayed, he said money will be charged if we delay the interview again. Previously also I had requested a delay, and he replied the same thing. And still it was delayed, due to my father's health. I'm trying to convince him to delay the interview until October this year, but he's keen on getting the visa before that. \n\nMy question is: If only my brother and his wife are going to the USA, is it necessary for me to apply for a visa too? I'm an Indian resident, and maybe they ask questions like \"Whole Family WAS going? Why now only you two are going?\" due to which, I'm being told, the visa can be denied. \nAlso, Can I opt of out this Interview? I don't want the visa this year… It'll be raining there in USA until October, after which it'll be snowing… I was thinking of writing a opt out email to the embassy, but guess that's not a good idea. \n\nCould anyone suggest of what I could do to avoid wasting my time for an interview which for sure is again going to be delayed. I'm only asking if I can opt out, without interfering with my brother's visa approval.\n",

For this purpose, I purchased tickets via trainline.com and these were delivered to the USA  (perhaps it was a bad idea, but its done now!).\n\n\n\nI am confused as to how to use these tickets/this ticket.  The folks at Trainline.com were unable to help me via telephone. I noticed that when I use Trainline's route service, this was returned:\n\n\n\nSo the ticket(s) I have:\n\n\nWhere do I use them? At London Heathrow underground or elsewhere?\nShould I get other tickets for the tube journey between Heathrow underground to Liverpool street station?\nRelated: Where exactly is Heathrow underground with relation to terminal 2?\n\n\nPlease do let me know if I can improve this question in any fashion.\n",

The 1st - marked single. Is the actual ticket. And the 2nd one is your seat reservation for the fixed portion of your journey from London Liverpool Street. Which I see is at 13.30. It also shows your seat Your ticket is valid on the underground, but is not limited to a certain train. The ticket you have does not require you to purchace additional tube tickets. It is included (that is indicated by the U1256 on the ticket) You use the ticket (marked single) to operate the access gates at the underground and railway stations. You must travel on the 13.30 from Liverpool St. The ticket is not valid for any other train. But for the underground you can travel on any train that will connect you to Liverpool Street, and from Heathrow they depart between every 4 to 8 minutes. You must present if requested by a ticket inspector both portions, if you don't you may be liable to a penalty fare. For information the tube does not run directly to Liverpool Street from Heathrow and you will require a change. There are several options but Holborn is on reasonable option. Finally. From T2 all you need to do is follow the signs to the underground, there is a subterranean walkway, and it will take you a couple of minutes. CANNOTANSWER",

You have not specified the end of check-in time, which sometimes is not even provided! It depends on the particular hotel but something between 10 PM and midnight is common. Any time you expect that your arrival will occur during or after those hours, simply call the hotel and let them know that you are coming and an approximate time. Do not forget to factor time to disembark, collect luggage, customs, immigration, waiting for transport and getting to there. There is another case which is usually specified clearly and that is when check-in is impossible after a certain time. The only times I saw this was for a few small properties in Taiwan where the front desk is not open after certain hours since the attendant goes home.

You should note that most of those all-dead crashes are in Taiwan, mostly smaller planes. A couple of the larger ones were at the old airport, which isn't exactly the best (swing by SongShan airport if you are ever in Taiwan, it is pretty bad.) The new airport is much nicer.

In the Netherlands people tend to kiss three times. In Belgium it is one kiss on greeting. Kissing is considered more intimate. In France people kiss either 2 or 4 times. However, even since the custom is three kisses in the Netherlands there are still quite some who really don't like the kissing and always approach with a firm hand. You indicated that you do the same, which I think is the best thing you can do. Personally I do kiss on the cheek as a greeting, but not always. It is a subtle nuance hard to explain. If you are okay with handshakes you shouldn't worry. First people are in general quite considerate and will understand that with your different background you can't be expected to know the greeting standards. I have known people who just used the custom from their background, being either a small bow or a greeting with the hands put together and a subtle head down. It is the gesture that counts. People meeting you will probably appreciate you and your cultural background and will like the gesture. I am not saying that everybody will accept it, but those that don't will have more issues, so it is not worth being bothered about them. CANNOTANSWER",

Check in rates if lower than normal, give them an indication that perhaps it won't be full and a 330 isn't required.

Taking Amsterdam as an example, the city is often booked out, weekends, (school)holiday periods, when there is a big event and so on, but 35 minutes by local train you can almost always get a hostel bed, even on the busiest days in Amsterdam. It is even likely that with a good internet search you will find a few beds left in the city which the tourist information office can not find. In some countries, the Netherlands among them, the tourist information office can find you a place to stay (if not always in town) but mostly you pay for the service. I do not know for Germany and Poland, but if stuck I would try to use their services. Booking hostels the night before, or even calling at 10 AM to see if there are beds free after the overnight crowd has left, has worked well for me and all family members who travel that way, even in the summer holidays. It will allow you the flexibility, the ease of mind to always have a place to stay and the freedom to go sight seeing upon arriving in a city. CANNOTANSWER",

In the interest of cost, I've heard that some hotels/airlines can take group bookings at cheaper rates, but I have no idea how this stuff works. Is creating a package like this reasonable?

Plus if they are starting in different cities, it becomes a nightmare. And group rates aren't any cheaper than discounted airfares. Concentrate on the destination package, hotels, airport meet & greets, transfers, local flights, plus meals if you wish. Two ways to go about it, contact your favorite travel agencies near home asking for some prices or go direct to an inbound agency at the destination. They both have pluses and minuses. Your local travel agency will be more expensive as they need to add in something for their time and work, but they maybe easier for your guests to pay. The destination agency will be more economical and knowledgeable, but may require you to collect all payments and wire it or perhaps can accept direct credit card payments. CANNOTANSWER",

      "background": "The advice is given many times to not get into \"illegal taxis\", because they will scam you. My question is: what are the possible ways of scam, if you agree on the price and destination in advance (e.g. by showing it on a map)?\n\nWell, I can imagine that taxi driver at the end says a higher price then agreed, but then what happens if you just give him the previously agreed price and walk away? In the answers of another related question it was mentioned that the taxi driver could deliberately \"misunderstand\" the location, but that would be covered by showing the map part.\n\nFor the sake of this question, let's consider only countries, where being kidnapped/robbed/killed by the taxi driver and such extreme outcomes are extremely rare. Say, Europe, US, and other countries considered \"safe\". (In other words, let's suppose you don't have to consider the risk that \"the taxi driver will kidnap you\".)\n\nAs answers I'm either expecting any theoretical possibility where you could be \nscammed, or even better concrete known instances of such scams (i.e. the tourist had to pay more, in spite of doing the above due diligence).\n\nOne particular example: I heard once (but not sure if it is true or not, since I can't find anything on Google about it), that a possible scam is agreeing on say \"30 dollars\" in advance. Then, at the end of the ride, it turns out that the taxist did not think about \"US dollars\", but \"some other kind of dollars\" (which of course are much more valuable then \"US dollars\"), and maybe he has even an accomplice to validate that (\"Yes, of course, in this country we always refer to XXX dollars, not US dollars.\") But as I said, I can't find anything about this, so maybe it does not exist at all.\n\nBackstory: I was in a Balkan country, waiting for the bus to the airport, together with two locals (or at least they were from some other Balkan countries). A taxi rolled up, and offered to take the three of us to the airport for an extremely low price (basically what the bus ticket per person would have cost). I double checked the price I would have to pay with the taxi driver, before getting in, but was still expecting some bad surprise when we arrived. In the end, everything went fine though, he just asked for the price we had agreed on (and besides that I willingly gave him a tip), but at this point I'm wondering what was in it for him? (The total the three of us payed was less than half of the regular fare it would have cost to get to the airport.)\nEven though I had luck this time, I still think it was foolish from me to just get into the cab, and I would like to know what else could have gone wrong. (Btw.: I used the term \"illegal taxi\" at the beginning, this one seemed pretty legal though - had the sign at the top, taximeter, etc.)\n",

It's certainly not the case that all drivers operating off the books are innately evil, or operating with a goal other than making a profit on driving you somewhere. It's also not the case that all licensed vehicles are driven by angels. Having said all that, for the type of situation you describe, a plausible negative situation is the driver stopping half way through the trip into town to renegotiate the price.

But I'm curious if there is a part of the airplane that offers the smoothest ride.  That is, most free from vibrations during flight, or during take-off and landing.\n\nI imagine the answer may be different for aircraft that have their engines mounted on the tail versus those with the engines mounted on the wings.

Take-off/landing is a little different. For take-off there's not a lot of difference - the nose of the plane leaves the ground first so there's normally a sharper movement at the front as that occurs, but the front is also off the ground earlier so potentially less bumpy for a short period of time. For landing, the intention is for the rear wheels to hit the ground first, followed by the nose wheels. Presuming that happens, the front is much more smooth, and feels less of the bounce as the plane initially hits the ground. In a bad landing the nose wheel can hit the ground around the same time as the other wheels, which causes a shock at the front of the plane worse than what you'd normally feel at the back - but that's pretty rare. Of course, the other way to answer the question is that the \"smoothest\" ride is in whichever part of the plane First Class is - if only because the seats are more comfortable (and the alcohol is free!) so you won't feel the bumps as much as in economy.

One of the many cultural differences I noticed was that Japanese ATMs were rather different to those in other parts of Asia, North America, or in Europe. \n\nIn particular, every one I encountered presented money towards the user displayed \"in full\", usually up from the ground, as if it were a pile of cash resting on a table. Every other ATM I've ever used shoves out a (probably) thin wadge of notes, with the edge of the wadge presented towards the user, and the face of the notes hidden until the user removes them. \n\nWhy? Given the extra engineering effort in making machines like this, and the vast amount of cultural background to money in Japan, I'd be surprised if it's sheer chance. \n\nHere's an attempt at illustrating what I'm on about: \n\nJapanese ATM --  Yen come out of a grey slot, presented face-up towards the user, not held on any side:\n\n\n\n[e.g.] US ATM -- Money comes out in a thin wadge held by rollers:\n\n\n",

And by cash I don't mean you put the money in an envelope and tell the machine how much is there, I mean you put the money into the tray and the machine counts it and tells YOU how much is there. Yes, it is possible for customer B to receive exactly the same banknote that customer A deposited 5 minutes previously. The same mechanism is used for deposits and withdrawals, so the reason for the large bin should now be obvious - it is designed around the need to accept paper money, not just dispense it. The machines accept (and dispense) coin as well. That's what the smaller bin on the left side is for. They only accept up to about 200 coins at a time so emptying the change bin isn't as convenient as it sounds, but it's way easier than rolling. CANNOTANSWER",

The flights from A->B and C->A are more than 15 days apart and I have my own ways of traveling from B->C independent of the airline. \n",

          "context": "Depends on your ticket conditions and the airline in question, but odds are pretty likely the answer is no. What you have sounds like an open-jaw return: you've basically paid for A-B/B-A return as a single ticket, with a small surcharge to return from C instead. Airlines will generally not refund any portion of a return ticket after the journey has begun (= you have flown one half of it), and this applies to open-jaw returns as well. A \"true\" multi-city itinerary consists of a series of one-way flight tickets tacked onto each other. These would usually let you refund individual segments, because they're separate tickets under the hood, but they also usually cost a lot more. CANNOTANSWER",

This way, the carrier's liability is waived if you don't get into your destination.\n\nWhat is the form called? In other words, what exactly should I ask for?\n\nMore likely than not, I'm going to have to ask for this at Tbilisi airport, from where I'm taking a flight to Doha in 3 days (in transit to London). As I only hold an ID card, which is accepted for the UK (my destination), I don't expect to get an easy time boarding the Tbilisi-Doha flight (even though I'll not be entering Qatar), because Timatic doesn't explicitly state that I can transit Qatar on my ID (nor does it state the opposite). Hence, such a form would be of great help.\n\nI've read about this in this blog, where the author, who had trouble boarding a flight to Minsk for transit with her Portuguese ID card, writes:\n\n\n  I wrote some haiku style poems on my phone until the airline man came with a sheet for me to sign: 'It's to make you responsible for coming back, in case they don't allow you to stay in Minsk or enter Georgia.'\n\n",

That's for booking it online.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure what price it'd be if I were to turn up on the day and buy a ticket for the next train going that way.\n\nHere in Ireland if you book train tickets online in advance, it's much cheaper than if you arrive in the train station and want to buy a ticket for the next train. (e.g. €20 online vs. €60 last minute in some cases). Is this the same in the Netherlands with NS or is it the same price regardless of when you book?\n\nUpdate I don't care what sort of train to take, I just want to get from Eindhoven to Amsterdam.\n\nMoney isn't too much of an issue, I just don't want to be asked to pay €50 per ticket when I could have got it for <€20 had I only booked online!\n",

There's a direct train between Eindhoven and Amsterdam Central Station which would cost you €17.90 one way. If you buy the ticket at the counter, instead of at the machine, you'll have to pay an additional €0.5.

Fellow travellers can make use of this system after 09:00 on weekdays, the whole day during weekends and also the whole day during the months July and August. When I was a student I've had this question asked several times. When a conductor asked the other person why he had a ticket with 40% discount, I would just say that we travelled together, making the discounted ticket valid. CANNOTANSWER",

I have found this website: Comboios De Portugal.\n\nA complication is that we are not exactly sure when we will get to Faro.  So, if we book ahead then we will need to play safe and book a fairly late train.  Alternatively, we could just turn up at the station and buy on the spot.  My experience with UK trains is that this is a poor strategy as the prices will be bad and we might not even get seats.  So, here is the question: which of these strategies?\n\n\nBook ahead as the prices will be better and we will certainly get seats.  Accept that we may need to hang around in Faro for a few hours.  \nJust turn up at the station.  The prices will be the same or similar and there will be little danger of no seats.  \nSomething else that I have missed.  \n\n\nThe prices on the website seem reasonable and first class is not much more so we will probably go first class.  \n\nUpdate.  I am on the train now.  It was at the platform 30 minutes before departure and it departed exactly on time.  Despite the booking site showing that it was nearly full, it is in fact almost empty.  I guess that more may get on at intermediate stops.  The carriage is nice: roomy, clean, and comfortable.  Storage for large bags is not great.  If it was actually full then it might have been a problem.  However, it is at least as good as trains in the UK.  \n\nOne minute late out of Loule and a few people got on.\n\n7 minutes late out of Tunes and it is close to full now.\n\nFinal update after quite a few trips.  Ticket buying is easy online for major routes and you do not need to print the tickets.  You will be asked for an ID number, e.g. passport, but we never had this checked.  Local trains may require old style paper tickets bought at the station. It is a good idea to book several days ahead in a busy season as the trains often sell out.  Punctuality is erratic. It seemed good at first with delays of at most 10 minutes but later we had some trains 30 or 40 minutes behind schedule.\n",

          "context": "Prices in Portuguese trains do change with time. This only happens in intercity trains, like the one you want to get. This is a fairly new trend. Prices used to be the same all the time bought online or not. In advance or not. The market is now starting to develop at this level. This means you can get good deals if buying in advance, but don't lose your sleep over this. The prices don't go insane if buying at last minute. Good advice that I can give you is to choose the bus over the train to go from Algarve to Lisbon. I love trains and would love to tell you otherwise, but unfortunately, the frequency of trains from Algarve is quite low and it often gets delayed on route. CANNOTANSWER",

The card is irrelevant if you use the passport machines but if you see a human you are apparently supposed to show the card when you hand over your passport so he doesn't give you crap for using the wrong line or not filling in the landing card. If you don't get the card on that first entry (this happened to me) the follow-up email telling you that you were successfully registered will include a link to a PDF copy of the front side of the card, which you should print and carry instead to avoid being yelled at; when you subsequently see an IO that actually has the plastic cards they'll give you one then.

[If in doubt, check that the airport code of your destination airport appears on your bag claim tag; but most check-in agents will spontaneously tell you whether the bag has been checked through]. When you arrive in the UK, collect your suitcase and go through one of the \"arrivals from outside EU\" lanes at customs (color-coded red if you have goods to declare, green if you don't). This is the general procedure for all arriving flights into the EU that connect to an intra-EU flight, unless the final destination is a domestic airport without any customs presence. For completeness (and in contrast to what someone said in a comment), you will not have to go through immigration in Frankfurt either. Since where you came from (the US) and where you're going to (the UK) are both outside the Schengen area, you don't need to leave the extra-Schengen part of the airport in Frankfurt. (Of course, if your layover is long enough and you have a passport that gives you visa-free entry to Schengen, you still have a choice of going through immigration anyway and have a look around).

A uniform Schengen visa allows you to enter and transit through any of the Schengen states (including Iceland and France) for as long as the visa is valid.

To accomplish this, simply indicate the number of entries you require (2 or multiple) on the Schengen visa form, and justify the number of entries you have requested by providing proof of your need to leave and enter the Schengen area multiple times. In accordance with European visa regulations, do make sure that you apply to the Schengen consulate that you will be spending more time in (i.e., apply to the Icelandic embassy if you plan to spend more traveling days there, otherwise apply to France).

However, make sure that you've correctly set the \"Sales city\" to be a city in the country where you will be buying the ticket, as ticket prices can vary depending on where you purchase them. So if you set the sale city to be SFO, it's possible that an Australian travel agency will not be able to sell the ticket at the same price. It's also helpful to give the section that is headed : \"Fare construction (can be useful to travel agents)\" to the travel agent. This will show how the fare has been \"priced\", and whilst it's not needed for simple itineraries, it can help for more complex ones where the trip is potentially being booked as 2 or more separate fares. There are a few exceptions to the above, but they will generally be rare. eg, in some cases travel agents may choose not to sell a particular fare if they believe that certain components are not being priced correctly - for example, if the fuel surcharge isn't being correctly calculated, as it's possible for the airline to bill them for that after the fact. However these situations are extremely rare. CANNOTANSWER",

I am not sure however about the less touristy spots, because by the time I got to such spots, I already had the opportunity to change my USD into JMD. Which is what you want to do anyway because vendors accepting USD will usually give you a bad rate. For example in Dec 2013 one could get 103.5 JMD per USD at most cambios, and sometimes even 104 JMD per USD, but when accepting USD they generally used the rate 1 USD = 100 JMD. 2) Nobody ever had any problem with any of my USD notes being old, crumpled, dirty, etc. USD coins do not seem to be accepted though. Misc advice: Do NOT exchange your money at the MoBay airport, where the rates are nothing short of a colossal scam (something like 1 USD = 86 JMD even though the outside standard rate was 103.5).

However since the trip is supposedly only 20 miles, I am trying to find if it would be safe for a 20 member group to use this as a reliable means of transport both up and down from Singapore.  \n\nThe primary reason to ask this question is that someone has already planned this trip and they did not seem to factor in the safety part at all and I need to either say yes to participate, no to participate or altogether shoot down the idea if it would be too unsafe for anyone. Reading this page on travelfish adds to the confusion. \n\nAnyone have experience of this route?  Just so that I add the detail (in which spirit answers have been made) to ensure that this question isnt too broad or opinion based, I was only worried about accidents and personal life safety being a cause of concern.\n",

          "context": "I live in Singapore, and have taken ferries to Batam and Bintan (another nearby island). Let me first clear up the confusion you have acquired by reading that page on Travelfish.org. They mention that the ferry to Indonesia takes \"a couple of days\" and \"is no cheaper than flying.\" They are not referring to the ferry to Batam, but rather to the overall journey from Singapore to Java, which as outlined in the article takes three legs, Batam being the first, easiest, and least significant. With that out of the way: these ferries are extremely safe. The terminal and vessels bear some resemblance to a small airport, and none to the sometimes-chaotic \"bumboat\" ferries that make short trips elsewhere in the region. The ships are proper ships, with proper seating, very seaworthy in appearance, and completely sealed against the weather (which is often calm anyway). The ferry trip is not very long and the crew are professional. Singaporeans in general are not people who tolerate unsafe conditions (and there are plenty of them taking these ferries, due to work and also the many golf courses in Batam and Bintan). Enjoy the trip. If it weren't for the interesting scenes of cargo ships everywhere, you'd probably find it boring! CANNOTANSWER",

And if a 5 year validity bothers you for some reason, note that you can (but don't have to) replace your passport again once you turned 16 - you do not have to wait until it expires. PS. If anyone's curios, in some countries a child's passport is indeed different from an adult passport, and must be replaced when the child turns 16. However it is usually achieved by making the child passport expire at their 16th birthday, so it is rather obvious. As stated before, this is not the case in the USA. CANNOTANSWER",

And like most Asian countries, always show respect to elders. You don't have to tips at the restaurant, if you tip the waitress might return the tips. And this one might be wierd to you, don't finish the plate always let the host get the last piece.

Since I didn't want to go for the hostels that were more expensive, after some talking, some of the cheap hostels allowed me to sleep in the floor using my sleeping bag for half of the price. I also met some travelers that used the sleeping bag to sleep in train stations. In fact, I also did it once but just because I wanted to have the experience(I could have got a cheap bed in a hostel if I wanted to, there was no need to sleep in the station). So, If you are willing to travel without making booking in advance and also don't want to expend to much money, you should definitely take a sleeping bag with you. Otherwise I recommend you to take it only if you want to use it as a sheet in the hostels since most of them don't provide one. CANNOTANSWER",

      "background": "Next spring (second week of May), I'm looking to explore upstate New York before my sister's graduation from Syracuse - I live in California, and have never been to New York outside the city, so I've been exploring various travel options. Everything I've seen has made Buffalo much more attractive of an option, price-wise, to the point that I think it might well be worth the extra ~hour out of the way (from what I can tell from Google Maps) compared to the Rochester airport, or the Syracuse airport (obviously much more convenient; also crazy expensive from the west coast, plus I'd rather get the excuse to explore more anyway.)\n\nI can handle the extra drive time, but as I've never been to that area, I figured I would ask to make sure, weather-wise, whether that plan would be foolish. My mom, who has visited my sister there before, says when she was there in mid-April, there was still snow everywhere. So I suppose my two questions would be: \n\n\nIf I were thinking of driving from Buffalo to Letchworth National Park, then to Syracuse by way of passing through Watkins Glen, then back to Buffalo (obviously not in a day - I'd have over a week for this trip), how likely is it that I would encounter weather hazards (i.e. snow) in early May? \nIf the answer to #1 isn't \"highly unlikely\", and I were in a budget rental car, how well maintained would those roads be / how well equipped would a budget rental be to handle said hazards? \n\n",

          "context": "For question #1, highly unlikely. Contrary to the way it may seem from watching Weather Channel, Buffalo is not above the Arctic Circle nor is it in Siberia. The average daily highs for April in Watkins Glen, Syracuse and Buffalo are all in the 50's. More than warm enough to melt off any snows that lingered into early April. For question #2, if there does happen to be snow, I wouldn't worry about the roads. Having grown up in Maine and spending 4 years in college in upstate NY, I have found that the areas that get the most snow (like the Buffalo area) tend to do the best job of maintaining safe road conditions in the winter. Over the years, they have learned to manage those conditions better. I now live in NJ and I'm embarrassed at what passes for snow maintenance. I'd feel safer in an economy rental in NY than 4 wheel drive in NJ. CANNOTANSWER",

She will also be visiting for a month.\n\nHow can I safely pack these items with her? She'll be bring two consoles, a couple of games for each, a laptop, tablet, books and clothes. So far, my idea was to pack everything that can't be damaged into a checked bag, bring the consoles in the overhead bag, and her tablet/books in her carry-on. Is this a good strategy to prevent the most probably damage? What sort of accommodations should I make for going through security? I won't be going with her, so I can't go through security with her, or tell her how to get to her gate.

The guy offered to take me up to Kurseong for 900 rupees which is a bit much but it was in my budget. I took his jeep because he said I wouldn't have to pay a thing if we missed the train and although it usually takes around hour and a half to two hours, he said he could get me there in an hour. To make the story short, we didn't make it but I gave him 400 rupees nonetheless. I know that the drivers usually give false promises but this one would actually make it if he hadn't have lost time at the gas station and if there hadn't have been a huge traffic jam right at the entrance to Kurseong. He used a bunch of shortcuts but unfortunately lady luck wasn't on our side. Just for the info, one seat in a shared jeep is 90-150 rupees but you do have to wait for the jeep to get full. Also, don't pay for the gas or any expenses before you get to your destination. The price is the same if you decide to go directly to Darjeeling. CANNOTANSWER",

      "background": "Background\n\nI've recently entered a relationship with a person from Canada. Part of that commitment involves visiting frequently throughout the year; this commonly involves me driving to pick her up, as opposed to flying to save cost, so she can stay with me in the US. She's planning on coming up to visit again for the entirety of the Summer (four to five months).\n\nExtra information in case it has any impact:  \n\n\nShe is 20 years old.\nShe is a third-year university student and is committed to her program for another two years.\nShe has visited the US three times already this year. Twice to visit me (~five weeks in total); once to visit her friend (five days).\nWe've both lived in our respective countries all our lives.\nI've only stayed in Canada with her for a few days at a time.\n\nMy Knowledge\nFeel free to edit this information if any of it is misleading/incorrect.\n\nThe 180-day limitation mentioned in these threads [ 1 ][ 2 ] are for people who visit in one consecutive stay; not for totaling 180 days in the year.\nShe will be considered a resident alien of the US if she crosses the 183-day mathematical formula, as noted on this AmericanLaw website:\n\n\n  A foreign national will meet the Substantial Presence Test if he or she is present in the United States for 31 days in the current year and the sum of the following:  \n  \n  \nsum of the days present in the United States in the current year,  \none-third of the number of days present in the first preceding year,  \none sixth of the days present in the second preceding year equals or exceeds 183 days.\n\n  \n  If a Canadian meets the Substantial Presence Test but is ineligible to meet the Closer Connection Exception (i.e. since he or she is present in the United States for more than 183 days in the current year), he or she will be considered to be a resident alien of the United States. Resident aliens are taxed on worldwide income in the same manner as United States citizens.\n\n\nQuestion\n\nAre there any common limitations, mainly regarding stay durations or frequencies, that could make further visits throughout the year difficult or impossible?\n\n\nAlso, I fully understand that a visitation could be rejected for many reasons and that there's no guarantees regardless of how long of stay. I'm simply trying to avoid breaking any rules or missing any legal obligations that can come up from this international relationship. This is all foreign to me— pun was most certainly intended.\n",

If you check in to both flights in advance, with electronic boarding passes, and have no bags, the connection will be straightforward. However, DPS-SIN is an international flight, so you will need to clear Immigration at Denpasar, and depending on your nationality (in particular, if you need a visa for Singapore) Jetstar may require you to check in in person to show your documents. My main concern with your plan is that Air Asia does not have a great on-time record, so you don't have a whole lot of buffer if they're delayed, and Jetstar will show you no mercy if they are.

True and DTAC both have 4G networks, and the tourist plans also have free wifi which is widely available in almost all public venues. Getting set up on the wifi involves sending an SMS to get a password (the username is your phone number). You can ask the staff when you buy the card and by should be happy to set you up. There aren't so many data only / tablet / midi SIM options, and asking for one may complicate the issue. My advice would be to go for the tourist smartphone sims, have the staff set you up before you leave the counter. Topping up is simple and can be done online or in any 7-11 store. CANNOTANSWER",

Both operate on a stored-value principle, but the fares are lower with CharlieCard than with CharlieTicket.\n\nSince I only have a few days, my instinct is that the paper CharlieTicket will be cheaper for me -- but on the other hand, during that time, I'm going to ride a lot more than the typical local, or even the typical tourist. So there's a possibility that the CharlieCard will break even for me.\n\nHowever, I can't for the life of me find anywhere on the MBTA website where it says what the price of a CharlieCard is. Without knowing that in advance it is hard to figure out where the break-even point is.\n\nDoes anyone here happen to know?\n\n(The card price may be disguised as a minimum non-refundable balance or something similar, like some other contractless transit payment card systems do, but I can't find anything about that either).\n\n\n\nBonus question: If I determine the card is advantageous for me, is there somewhere at Logan airport I can buy one at around 7pm on a Sunday? The MBTA's list of points-of-sale requires me to select a particular neighborhood of Boston from a textual list before it will show me anything, and I don't know which of them contains the airport.\n",

          "context": "Normally the programs are independent. Earning miles goes to one program and that program sets its own expiry date policy. To postpone expiry (which is possible with every reward program I know but it might not be the case for all) you must have activity in the account whose miles are about to expire. Any activity will do, so you can fly with another Star Alliance member and have them credit the miles to the account you want to postpone expiry. Also, flights are not necessarily needed, you can spend with a partner which are numerous (flower shops, hotels, cars, etc, depending on the program). The point though is that the activity has to be in that account, not any other one, even if it is with Star Alliance. Addendum: Victoria has a set expiry after 3 years of arcual which can be extended for a charge. Many other Star Alliance programs though, such as Aeroplan by AirCanada and Mileage Plus by United Airlines, do not have a set expiry but the whole lot of miles gets its expiry pushed forward when there is activity in the account. These are distinct programs from Victoria and so getting any of these will not prevent current Victoria miles from expiring. CANNOTANSWER",

Unless there is specific language in the insurance terms that come with you CC (which you should read carefully from start to finish) this is the most likely situation. You could also contact the issuer of your CC for details on the policy. CANNOTANSWER",

If you already know that you're definitely going and when you're going, then book the best deal you can find as soon as you decide you will go. And then don't look back. It is possible, but not particularly likely, that prices will drop after you book, but it's not worth regretting if they do -- they might just as well have gone up. If you haven't yet decided that you will definitely go, you can bide your time -- and then pounce if you happen to see a deal so good that it makes you decide to go. Then, again, don't look back.

The only exception is major car rental companies, which normally require you to hold a credit card for a rental. Hotels and other places which might put a hold on your card don't care if it's credit or debit. On the Internet all cards are generally accepted as well. Some airlines like to cheat you a bit by charging you more if you pay by credit card, but you would be informed about the surcharge before you pay. I've also seen an obscure exception where the US embassy only accepts debit cards for visa fee payments, but that's obviously of no relevance to US visitors. CANNOTANSWER",

Almost all the parts in the desktop were cheaper than the tax-free allowance except the Video Card.\n\nWhat will I be charged for? For the sum of all the components prices or only for the video card? \n",

If I want to bring 5 of them, that is 500 which is over the limit. So taking something apart or opening a package will not normally reduce your duty in any way. The thing about the single item suggests that a small trick may be available: a single 500-pound item would pay duty on 500 pounds, but 500 1-pound items might only mean paying duty on the excess items for 110 pounds. Before I tried such a thing I would check the duty rates, which could be different for computer parts than they are for computers that are fully assembled. Also, many border guards just wave you through when you have a little over the limit, but if you irritate them (by making them count 500 items, for example) they may get nitpicky. I would definitely file this under \"advanced techniques.\" CANNOTANSWER",

After that, I did receive an email confirmation with all of the correct information.\n\nIt seems odd that I could reserve this room without providing a credit card, especially since their cancellation policy says they will charge for one night after a certain date.

The hotel seems very busy this time of year, they probably aren't that bothered if someone cancelled the day before, and they may even be hopeful of cash payment on arrival or charge more for a card (if places still even do that). I know with small family ran places no card details are usually asked for, and for big chains they can allow cancellation same day upto 1pm.

There is no standard cell broadcast channel for official warnings. The very few countries using cell broadcast messages incorporated in some kind of official warning system are all using proprietary solutions. According to the forum reports, the \"21 Lisboa\" message is sent on channel 50, which if used at all, in Europe is mostly used for location information. Checking which cell broadcast services are in use in Portugal, the network operators Vodafone and MEO are also indeed using channel 50 for location information. MEO is having or used to have different tariffs for local and long distance calls to fixed line telephones and the location broadcast on channel 50 indicated which area code was charged as a local call. 21 is btw the area code of Lisbon.

So my travel plan is as follows:\n\n\nNew Delhi to Rome\nWill stay in Rome for one day\nFlying from Rome to Venice\nStaying one more day in Venice\nFlying from Venice to US (Seattle)\n\n\nI can't apply for a Schengen visa due to shortage of time. I searched a little bit on \"Italy Transit Visa\" and got to know that there are three types of categories:\n\n\nTransit Visa-A: or Airport Transit Visa: If your connecting flight to your destination is in the next couple of hours (not more than 12 hours / Not sure) from the same Airport. You might need to apply for such a visa (Some countries' citizens are obliged to stay in the airport area without having an Airport transit visa). \nTransit Visa-B: Destined for the travellers planning to travel through different Schengen countries by car or travel through different Schengen airports to a non-Schengen country for as a final destination. Under the transit visa one is allowed to reside in a Schengen area for a maximum of 5 days.\n\n\nReference: Information about Schengen Visa\n\nI also read that If you have a valid US visa then you don't need to take an Airport Transit Visa (Same if your citizenship comes into the following cities). Is it also valid for the B-Category as well? \n\nMy travel plans won't take more than 5 days. Am I applicable for Transit Visa-B. If yes, then can I apply for this visa on arrival in Italy?\n",
